Dissertation
============

This repository contains all the necessary files to build my
dissertation. This includes the text, data, and figures. Languages used
will (probably) include:

  * XeTeX
  * Gnuplot
  * Python (if necessary)
  * Various shell scripts

While it is tempting to integrate the two, the data analysis will be
separate from the dissertation. If this sounds interesting to you, check
out Sweave (an unholy merging of LaTeX and R). I would do it myself if I
hadn't already set myself the goal of using gnuplot (I may end up
returning to Veusz instead).
