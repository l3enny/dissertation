This work reports on an investigation of a repetitively-pulsed nanosecond
discharge (\textsc{rpnd}) in helium over a range of 0.3-16.0 Torr. The discharge
was studied experimentally via laser-absorption spectroscopy and optical
emission spectroscopy measurements. In concert with the experimental campaign, a
global model of a helium plasma was developed with the aid of particle-in-cell
simulations. The global model was then used to predict the population kinetics
and emissions of the \acs{rpnd}. Synthesis of the results provided new data and
insights on the development of the \textsc{rpnd}.

Among the results were direct measurements of the triplet metastable states
during the excitation period. This period was found to be unexpectedly long at
low pressures (less than or equal to 1.0 Torr), suggesting an excess in
high-energy electrons as compared to an equilibrium distribution. Other
phenomena such as a prominent return stroke and additional energy deposition by
reflections in the transmission line were also identified. Estimates of the
electric field and electron temperatures were obtained for several conditions.
