\noindent several optical methods for electron temperature
measurement were evaluated for application to the discharge. Based on the global
model simulations, the coronal model was found to apply in the line ratio of the
3$^3$S-2$^3$P$\odd$ and 3$^1$S-2$^1$P$\odd$ transitions, however further work is
needed to ascertain its applicability to experimental discharges.

These results provide new insight on the development of the repetitively-pulsed
nanosecond discharge. Specifically, they reveal new information about the
excited state dynamics within the discharge, the non-equilibrium nature of its
electrons, and several new approaches for future studies. This study extends the
present understanding of repetitively-pulsed discharges, and advances the
knowledge of energy coupling between electric fields and plasmas.
