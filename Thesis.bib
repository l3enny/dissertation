@article{Adamovich2009,
abstract = {A new analytic quasi-one-dimensional model of energy coupling to nanosecond pulse discharge plasmas in plane-to-plane geometry has been developed. The use of a one-dimensional approach is based on images of repetitively pulsed nanosecond discharge plasmas in dry air demonstrating that the plasma remains diffuse and uniform on a nanosecond time scale over a wide range of pressures. The model provides analytic expressions for the time-dependent electric field and electron density in the plasma, electric field in the sheath, sheath boundary location, and coupled pulse energy. The analytic model predictions are in very good agreement with numerical calculations. The model demonstrates that (i) the energy coupled to the plasma during an individual nanosecond discharge pulse is controlled primarily by the capacitance of the dielectric layers and by the breakdown voltage and (ii) the pulse energy coupled to the plasma during a burst of nanosecond pulses decreases as a function of the pulse number in the burst. This occurs primarily because of plasma temperature rise and resultant reduction in breakdown voltage, such that the coupled pulse energy varies approximately proportionally to the number density. Analytic expression for coupled pulse energy scaling has been incorporated into the air plasma chemistry model, validated previously by comparing with atomic oxygen number density measurements in nanosecond pulse discharges. The results of kinetic modeling using the modified air plasma chemistry model are compared with time-resolved temperature measurements in a repetitively pulsed nanosecond discharge in air, by emission spectroscopy, and purely rotational coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy showing good agreement.},

@article{Babich1990,
abstract = {The concepts of local and nonlocal models of the breakdown of dense gases are introduced. The basis for a nonlocal model with runaway electrons is discussed. Experimental results on electric discharges in dense gases which develop in a regime of intense electron runaway, in contrast with the classical forms of gas discharges, are reviewed. It is shown that electron runaway plays a fundamental role in the breakdown dynamics of dense gases over a wide range of conditions. Space-time and energy characteristics of the pulses of runaway electrons and of the accompanying x radiation are reported. The involvement of runaway electrons in the breakdown mechanism can be seen in a shift of the minimum on the U ( Pd ) curves toward higher values of Pd as the overvoltage increases. When the overvoltage reaches a large factor, a polarization selfacceleration, as discussed by Askar'yan, occurs, and runaway electrons with energies $\epsilon$ > eU max are generated. The breakdown of a dense gas in a strong field differs from that at a moderate overvoltage in that it ceases to be a purely volume process.},

abstract = {Time-resolved and spatially resolved temperatures in repetitively pulsed nanosecond discharges in air and ethylene-air mixtures have been measured by purely rotational Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Specroscopy (CARS). The experiments have been done in a capacitively coupled plane-to-plane discharge and in an atmospheric pressure near-surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD), both powered by repetitive nanosecond duration voltage pulses. Gated ICCD camera images demonstrated that the capacitively coupled discharge plasma remains diffuse and stable, with no sign of arc filaments. Comparison of the experimental results with plasma chemical kinetic modeling calculations shows good agreement. The results demonstrate that the rate of heating in the fuel-air plasma is significantly more rapid compared to the one in the air plasma. Kinetic model analysis shows that this occurs due to exothermic reactions of fuel with radical species generated in the plasma, such as O atoms. The present results provide additional insight into kinetics of hydrocarbon fuel oxidation in low-temperature plasmas and into the mechanism of localized heating of air flows by nanosecond DBD discharges.},

@article{Bao2007,
abstract = {This paper presents results of low-temperature plasma-assisted combustion experiments in premixed ethylene-air and methane-air flows. The plasma was generated by high-voltage, nanosecond pulse duration, high repetition rate pulses. The high reduced electric field during the pulse allows efficient electronic excitation and molecular dissociation, thereby generating a pool of chemically active radical species. The low duty cycle of the repetitively pulsed discharge improves the discharge stability and helps sustain diffuse, uniform, and volume filling nonequilibrium plasma. Plasma temperature was inferred from nitrogen second positive band system emission spectra and calibrated using thermocouple measurements in preheated flows (without plasma). The experiments showed that adding fuel to the air flow considerably increases the flow temperature in the plasma, up to DeltaT = 250degC-350degC. On the other hand, adding fuel to nitrogen flow at the same flow and discharge conditions resulted in a much less pronounced plasma temperature rise, only by about DeltaT = 50degC. This shows that temperature rise in the air-fuel plasma is due to plasma chemical fuel oxidation reactions initiated by the radicals generated in the plasma. In a wide range of conditions, generating the plasma in air-fuel flows resulted in flow ignition, flameholding, and steady combustion downstream of the discharge. Plasma-assisted ignition occurred at low air plasma temperatures, 100degC-200 degC, and low discharge powers, \~{}100 W (\~{}1\% of heat of reaction). At these conditions, the reacted fuel fraction is up to 85\%-95\%. The present results suggest that the flow temperature rise caused by plasma chemical fuel oxidation results in flow ignition downstream of the plasma.},

@article{Meek1940,
abstract = {The breakdown of a uniform field is considered to occur by the transition of an electron avalanche proceeding from cathode to anode into a self-propagating streamer, which develops from anode to cathode to form a conducting filament between the electrodes. A criterion is put forward for such a transition, viz., a streamer will develop when the radial field about the positive space charge in an electron avalanche attains a value of the order of the external applied field. For then photoelectrons in the immediate vicinity of the avalanche will be drawn into the stem of the avalanche and will give rise to a conducting filament of plasma, and a self-propagating streamer proceeds towards the cathode. The theory thus depends on ionization by electrons and photo-ionization in the gas and dispenses with the classical assumption of ionization by positive ions in the gas or secondary actions at the cathode. On this basis an equation for breakdown is developed, and reference to $\alpha$/p-X/p curves enables the potential required for breakdown to be determined. Satisfactory agreement between calculation and experiment is found in air for values of pressure times gap length down to p$\delta$∼100 mm Hg×cm. The theory does not conform absolutely to Paschen's law, but the deviations are within the present day margins of experimental error. For lower values of p$\delta$ the deviation between calculation and experiment is explained by the fact that the density of photo-ionization becomes small, and the secondary mechanism, $\gamma$, is observed in this region, so that classical theory applies. The theory is indicated to be consistent with all the requirements so far established in connection with sparks for large p$\delta$ up to the lightning discharge.},

abstract = {Time–space-resolved optical emission spectroscopy was used for the investigation of a diffuse dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) in helium and in 95\%He + 5\%H 2 gas mixture. The DBD in helium was diffuse in the whole range of the applied voltage, while in the gas mixture the discharge operated in diffuse mode only in the regime with more than three current peaks. In the helium discharge, the excitation of hydrogen H $\beta$ is delayed compared with the excitation of the helium atomic line, while in the gas mixture both lines are excited simultaneously. Using the Stark polarization spectroscopy technique based on the He I 492.19 nm line and its forbidden counterpart, the electric field distribution (EFD) was measured in the cathode region of the DBD in helium and in the helium–hydrogen mixture. Electric field space distributions in both gas discharges, obtained at 20 kPa pressure, showed linear decreasing in the cathode region, which is a typical characteristic of the glow discharge. Linear fits of the EFDs showed that the length of the cathode fall region is smaller in the gas mixture than in pure helium. In the multiple current peak mode of the DBD, EFD was measured during each of the three current peaks and no noticeable difference between them is observed.},

@article{Muller2011a,
abstract = {The ignition phase and the transition to quasi dc glow operation of a narrow-gap near atmospheric pressure discharge in hydrogen are investigated experimentally. The discharge is ignited by a short 10 ns voltage pulse with a peak voltage of 1.3 kV followed by a 150 ns plateau of about 350 V. Pulsing is at 12 kHz which leaves a significant amount of residual charge between the individual pulses. Temporally resolved laser electric field measurement in the centre of the discharge employing a non-linear four-wave mixing scheme, ultra-high speed optical imaging by an ICCD camera at Balmer-alpha and Fulcher lines as well as the undispersed emission, and current and voltage measurements are performed. Special emphasis is put on a detailed analysis of the measured data by combining the results from the various diagnostics. This allows in addition to the directly measured quantities determination of the absolute evolution of the electron density, the development of space charge shielding, and the observation of the local electron dynamics. Pressure variations in a limited range indicate reasonable agreement with the Paschen law but also raise questions on the definition of the breakdown voltage under highly transient conditions.},

Nanosecond high-voltage pulses with durations of 1 and 5 ns and amplitudes of 100 and 200 kV, respectively, were used to study the parameters of the discharge in a pressured (1-7) × 105 Pa air-filled gap. The development of the discharge and the plasma propagation velocity was examined using optical fast frame imaging. The generation of runaway electrons in the breakdown process was confirmed by electron imaging and time-resolved x-ray diagnostics. Runaway electron beam energy distribution was obtained for a 1 ns duration high-voltage pulse. The origin and the role of runaway electrons in the discharge initiation are also discussed.},

abstract = {Values of the ratio of the longitudinal diffusion coefficient to mobility DL/$\mu$ for electrons in He, Ar, Kr, and Xe are derived from current waveforms obtained during earlier measurements of electron mobility. The electric field to gas density ratios E/N cover the wide range of 10-3 to 20 Td, thereby bridging previous experiments at low E/N to recent experiments at high E/N. Here 1 Td=1×10-21 V m2. The corresponding DL/$\mu$ values range from 0.0066 eV for thermal electrons at 77 K to 10 eV. In addition to the well‐known peak in DL/$\mu$ for Ar at E/N between 0.01 and 0.1 Td caused by the Ramsauer minimum in the momentum transfer cross section, we find previously unreported low‐energy peaks in DL/$\mu$ vs E/N in Kr and Xe and previously unreported pronounced leveling‐off in DL/$\mu$ at E/N≳8 Td in Ar, Kr, and Xe. Calculations of transport coefficients using numerical solutions of the Boltzmann equation and cross section sets in the literature give good agreement with experiment from E/N producing thermal electrons up to average energies ≊10 eV and E/N up to 100 Td, the upper limit of our calculations. The leveling off of DL/$\mu$ at high E/N is caused by inelastic collisions.},

Its emphasis on phenomonology and the results of real experiments distinguish this from all other texts available. Discussions of theory are reinforced with examples which illustrate and apply the theoretical formulism, thus aiding students in their reading and analysis of current literature. The text is designed to provide a core of material for students with minimal background in mathematics or quantum theory and offers more sophisticated material in separate sections.},

@article{Kong2003,
abstract = {Diffuse nonthermal gas discharges generated at atmospheric pressure have found increasing applications in many key materials processing areas such as etching, deposition, and structural modification of polymeric surfaces. To facilitate tailored and improved applications of these novel gas plasmas, we consider their pulsed generation based on one-dimensional numerical simulation of helium-nitrogen discharges. We consider four waveforms of the plasma-generating voltage, namely: 1) sinusoidal; 2) peak-levelled sinusoidal; 3) peak-levelled and tail-trimmed sinusoidal; and 4) pulsed with a Gaussian-shaped tail, all at the same repetition frequency of 10 kHz. For each case, voltage and current characteristics are calculated and then used to assess whether the generated plasma is diffuse and nonthermal. Densities of electrons, ions, and metastables are calculated, together with the dissipated electric power in the plasma bulk. It is found that plasma pulsing can significantly reduce the electric power needed to sustain diffuse nonthermal atmospheric plasmas. Specifically by choosing appropriate pulse shape, the plasma-sustaining power can be reduced by more than 50\% without reducing densities of electrons, ions, and metastables. On the other hand, electron density can be enhanced by 68\% with the same input electric power if the pulsewidth is suitably narrowed.},

abstract = {The electric field in streamer discharges in air can be easily determined by the ratio of luminous intensities emitted by N 2 ( C 3 $\Pi$ u ) and \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0963-0252/20/3/035012/psst370702in001.gif] \{\{$\backslash$rm N\}\_2\^{}+(B$\backslash$,\{\}\^{}2$\backslash$Sigma\_\{$\backslash$rm u\}\^{}+)\} if the steady-state assumption of the emitting states is fully justified. At ground pressure, the steady-state condition is not fulfilled and it is demonstrated that its direct use to determine the local and instantaneous peak electric field in the streamer head may overestimate this field by a factor of 2. However, when spatial and time-integrated optical emissions (OEs) are considered, the reported results show that it is possible to formulate a correction factor in the framework of the steady-state approximation and to accurately determine the peak electric field in an air discharge at atmospheric pressure. A correction factor is defined as $\Gamma$ = E s / E e , where E e is the estimated electric field and E s is the true peak electric field in the streamer head. It is shown that this correction stems from (i) the shift between the location of the peak electric field and the maximum excitation rate for N 2 ( C 3 $\Pi$ u ) and \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0963-0252/20/3/035012/psst370702in001.gif] \{\{$\backslash$rm N\}\_2\^{}+(B$\backslash$,\{\}\^{}2$\backslash$Sigma\_\{$\backslash$rm u\}\^{}+)\} as proposed by Naidis (2009 Phys. Rev. E 79 057401) and (ii) from the cylindrical geometry of the streamers as stated by Celestin and Pasko (2010 Geophys. Res. Lett. 37 L07804). For instantaneous OEs integrated over the whole radiating plasma volume, a correction factor of $\Gamma$ \~{} 1.4 has to be used. For time-integrated OEs, the reported results show that the ratio of intensities can be used to derive the electric field in discharges if the time of integration is sufficiently long (i.e. at least longer than the longest characteristic lifetime of excited species) to have the time to collect all the light from the emitting zones of the streamer. For OEs recorded using slits (i.e. a window with a small width but a sufficiently large radial extension to contain the total radial extension of the discharge) the calculated correction factor is $\Gamma$ \~{} 1.4. As for OEs observed through pinholes, the reported results demonstrate that for local OEs, the $\Gamma$ coefficient depends slightly on the radial position and is in a range [1.24, 1.28]. For line-integrated OEs, the radial variation of $\Gamma$ is more significant and $\Gamma$ is in the range [1.24, 1.38]. Finally, it is noted that the use of different sets of Einstein coefficients and quenching rates of excited states has negligible influence on the value of $\Gamma$.},

abstract = {Plasma decay after a high-voltage nanosecond discharge was studied experimentally and numerically in room temperature N 2 , CO 2 and H 2 O for pressures between 1 and 10 Torr. The time-resolved electron density was measured by a microwave interferometer for initial electron densities in the range 8 × 10 11 –3 × 10 12 cm −3 and the effective electron–ion recombination coefficient was determined. It was shown that this coefficient varies in time and depends on pressure. A numerical simulation was carried out to describe the temporal evolution of the densities of charged particles under the conditions considered. A good agreement was obtained between the calculated and the measured electron density histories. It was shown that the loss of electrons is governed by dissociative recombination with complex ions, their density being dependent on pressure. In N 2 at low pressures, a hindered electron thermalization in collisions with molecules led to a delay in the plasma decay. This effect was observed both experimentally and theoretically.},

@article{Aleksandrov2010,
abstract = {Observations of a shock wave propagating through a decaying plasma in the afterglow of an impulse high-voltage nanosecond discharge and of a surface dielectric barrier discharge in the nanosecondrange were analysed to determine the electron power transferred into heat in air plasmas in high electric fields. It was shown that approximately half of the discharge power can go to heat for a short (\~{}1 µs at atmospheric pressure) period of time when reduced electric fields are present at approximately 10 3 Td. A kinetic model was developed to describe the processes that contribute towards the fast transfer of electron energy into thermal energy under the conditions considered. This model takes into account previously suggested mechanisms to describe observations of fast heating in moderate (\~{}10 2 Td) reduced electric fields and also considers the processes that become important in the presence of high electric fields. Calculations based on the developed model agree qualitatively with analyses of high-voltage nanosecond discharge observations.},

abstract = {The dynamics of gas heating in fast pulsed discharges in nitrogen-oxygen mixtures was analyzed using a state-specific plasmachemical model and an energy conservation equation. It was shown that the heating rate changes over time according to the changes of the species involved in the heating processes. An increasing dependence on time was shown. The results show that higher electron density, electric field or partial pressure of oxygen leads to a faster gas heating. However, the heating rate associated with excitation of vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom is almost independent of the value of the applied field in the studied range of fields.},

@article{Nishihara2007,
abstract = {Modeling of a crossed pulser-sustainer discharge in the presence of a transverse magnetic field is used to obtain insight into the kinetics of a low-temperature magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) nitrogen plasma. Ionization in the discharge is produced by repetitive high-voltage nanosecond-duration pulses, while the low-voltage DC sustainer discharge couples power to the plasma between pulses. Model predictions are compared with the experimental sustainer discharge current, both without and with magnetic field, showing a satisfactory agreement. At low DC voltages (below the cathode voltage fall UC), the calculations show that the entire sustainer discharge, including the cathode layer, remains nonself-sustained and that the electric field does not penetrate into the plasma, which results in a very low sustainer current. This demonstrates that MHD power generation in low-temperature plasmas with MHD open voltages that are below the cathode fall is not feasible. At higher voltages (UDC > UC), when the cathode layer becomes self-sustained, the sustainer current grows approximately linear with the DC voltage. This occurs because the applied DC field does not produce any additional ionization in the plasma that is outside the cathode layer. In the presence of a magnetic field, the sustainer current is significantly lower than the current without a magnetic field, which is due to the Hall effect. At UDC > UC, the model predicts a significant electron and ion drift in the EtimesB direction due to the Lorentz force. Charge separation that is induced by the disparity in electron and ion mobilities also causes the entire plasma to shift in the EtimesB direction, which is approximately at the ion slip velocity. The estimated neutral flow velocity change due to a collisional momentum transfer from the charged to the neutral species in the plasma is consistent with the prediction of quasi-1-D phenomenological MHD equations, - as well as with the previous experimental results in a low-temperature MHD wind tunnel.},

abstract = {An analysis of experimental and theoretical investigations is the basis of this state-of-art review of models of fast ionisation waves (FIWs) and of characteristics and properties of these waves. The attention is concentrated on waves with the maximum possible velocities of 10 9 –2×10 10 cm s –1 when the amplitudes of voltage pulses are 20–300 kV. At low and moderate pressures the reduced intensity of the electric field in the front of a wave is so high that the front becomes a moving source of a beam of high-energy electrons in which the current can reach several kiloamperes. At moderate pressures the high-energy electrons in the wave front overtake the front and cause preliminary ionisation of the gas ahead of the front. At low pressures these electrons determine mainly the mechanism of the motion of the front. At high pressures (in excess of 200 torr) the main source of such preionisation is the radiation emitted by the front. The high rate of filling of the discharge volume with a plasma, high electric fields and high energies of the electrons in the front, and the slight heating of the gas make fast ionisation waves attractive for applications.},
