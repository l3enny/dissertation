Finally, I should express my gratitude for the student radio station, WCBN, and
all of its members. As the physical manifestation of mayhem, exuberance, and
contemplation (simultaneously), it has been the bedrock of my imagination. You
may be tempted to think that there is little which crosses over between nuclear
engineering and radio, but you would be wrong. That said, I think that science
(and the whole world) could benefit from a trip down into the deepest recesses
of Sun Ra's synthesizer. It'd clean out the waxy buildup.
