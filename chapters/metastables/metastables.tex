As was noted in Chapter~\ref{chp:introduction}, measurements of the \acs{rpnd}
have been mostly limited to the afterglow plasma or time-integrated quantites.
Electric field measurements, either with capacitive probes or nonlinear
wave-mixing, thus far provide the only insight on the development of the
\acs{rpnd} \cite{Ito2010, Muller2011a, Takashima2011}. Though the electric field
can be used to estimate electron densities and reaction rates in the plasma,
this requires a number of additional assumptions regarding electron locality,
and equilibrium with the applied field.

As a result, there is a lack of information on particle properties of the
\acs{rpnd} during its development. Such information is necessary to confirm the
present understanding of how these discharges develop, how they may be optimized
for specific applications, and how to improve existing numerical simulations.
Therefore, a clear need exists for direct measurements of the \acs{rpnd}
particle properties.

Unfortunately, this presents a significant challenge for most traditional plasma
diagnostics. In most situations, the obvious choice would be the Langmuir probe
given its simplicity and ease of implementation. However, the fast variations in
the plasma potential, slow response of the ions, and high collisionality all
preclude this approach \cite{Lieberman2005}. Furthermore, any physical probe
could potentially act as a large perturbation to the very system it is
measuring.

The logical alternative to physical probes is the use of optical diagnostics,
however these have their own associated difficulties. Electrons cannot be
directly studied by their light emissions because, with the exception of
bremsstrahlung and cyclotron radiation, they do not produce electromagnetic
radiation. This leaves the light emitted from excited atoms as the primary
source of information for electron energetics. Atomic emission spectroscopy can
be used to measure many different plasma quantities, from electron density, to
local electric field strength \cite{Griem2005}. Unfortunately, spontaneous
emission can be a slow process compared to the development of the \acs{rpnd}.
For example, the fastest neutral helium transition in visible wavelengths
(3$^3$D$_3$-2$^3$P$_2^\cdot$) has a decay rate of 14 ns \cite{Kramida2012}.

This suggests that instead of waiting for spontaneous emission to occur, it may
be better to use some form of active spectroscopy. Though the added complexity
of a well-characterized light source is undesirable, it allows for several
interesting opportunities. For example, a sufficiently intense laser can be used
to directly interact with the electrons through Thomson scattering. It has a
high spatial and temporal resolution and is able to measure the electron density
and temperature simultaneously \cite{VanGessel2012}. However, the \acs{rpnd} may
have densities well below the interaction limit of $5\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$
\cite{Pai2009}.

If it is not possible to directly interact with the electrons, the next
alternative is interact with the atomic population. Probing of the ground state
is difficult given its large separation from any excited state. Furthermore, the
high densities of the neutral states would completely absorb all incident
radiation, even over short pathlengths (leaving nothing to measure). Instead one
can probe excited atomic states. The lowest lying excited state is the triplet
metastable (2$^3$S), which resides at 19.82 eV above ground \cite{Kramida2012}.
This relatively large energy gap assures that no such states will be naturally
present at room temperature. The triplet metastable (and all higher-energy
states in helium) will be populated almost exclusively by energetic electrons.
Therefore, the triplet metastable density is a useful indicator of the electron
energetics in the \acs{rpnd} as it develops. With a sufficiently complex model,
it may even be used to infer properties of the electron population.

Perhaps the most straightforward means by which to measure the triplet
metastable density is with absorption spectroscopy. This approach has a long
history in the study of gas discharges, going back at least six decades
\cite{Phelps1953}. At its most basic, the technique involves illuminating a
plasma with light matching a transition between the metastable, and some upper
level. The amount of transmitted light is then measured with a detector on the
opposite side of the plasma. The amount of transmitted light is proportional to
the metastable density, integrated along the path of the light. As the temporal
bandwidth of this technique is only limited by the time required for the light
to traverse the plasma, it presents a promising approach for particle
measurements during the development of the \acs{rpnd}.

\section{Setup}

The light used in the absorption spectroscopy was provided by a
distribute-feedback laser diode. The general approach used was similar to that
of Millard et al. \cite{Millard1998}. The use of a laser in absorption
spectroscopy provides a relatively high intensity and natural spatial
selectivity as compared to the use of gas discharge tubes.

As with the study by Millard et al., the decision was made to study the
transition from the triplet metastable to the 2$^3$P$^\mathrm{o}_{0,1,2}$ state
(a transition wavelength of approximately 1083 nm). This was done for several
reasons. For one, the closest helium transition is over 7 nm away, making it
relatively isolated. In addition, the different levels or values of $J$ are all
within the tuning range of a single diode. As each level has a different
degeneracy, $g$, the strength of absorption varies depending on the selected
level. Thus, the absorption strength can be increased for low densities, or
decreased at high densities, improving the dynamic range of the diagnostic.

The laser used was a distributed feedback laser diode, produced by Toptica,
model LD-1083-0070-DFB-1. The specified linewidth of the laser was 3 MHz,
somewhat below the natural linewidth of the transition at 10.2 MHz, and much
less than the Doppler linewidth at 300 K (1.7 GHz). This can be exploited to
directly measure the gas temperature of the system, as will be seen in the next
section. The diode was rated for a total output power of 70 mW, with a beam size
of 1 mm by 3 mm and vertical polarization. The diode was housed in a Toptica DL
DFB housing which incorporated the collimating optics. A Toptica DCC 110 was
used to provide current control for the diode laser, and a Toptica DTC 110 was
used to control the thermoelectric cooler for the diode.

The layout in figure~\ref{fig:laser}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/metastables/figures/laser.eps}
  \caption{Optical beam path of the laser in the absorption spectroscopy
  experiment. DFB - Distributed feedback laser diode; FI - Faraday isolator; ND -
  neutral density filter; S - shutter; PD - photodiode; AP - aperture.}
  \label{fig:laser}
\end{figure}
reflects the optical beam path used in the absorption experiment. The laser
light is produced by the distributed feedback laser diode (DFB). It then enters
an Electro-Optics Technology, Inc. Faraday isolator (FI) which prevents
back-reflections from entering the diode. Without the isolator in place, such
back-reflections can cause mode-hopping, resulting in unreliable tuning. The
laser intensity is then reduced by a neutral density filter (ND). After which,
the laser passes through a Vincent Associates electronic shutter (S). Then, the
beam is split by a Thorlabs BSF10-C beam sampler at a 45$^\circ$ angle. This
reduced the laser intensity below the saturation intensity (0.45 mW/cm$^2$) of
the transition. The beam was collimated with two apertures (AP) on both sides of
the discharge apparatus. The beam exiting the apparatus was then sent through a
final aperture to filter nearly-colinear plasma emissions before it was coupled
into an optical fiber by a Thorlabs F240SMA-780 collimation package.

Behind the beam sampler was a Thorlabs DET300 germanium photodiode. The signal
from this photodiode was terminated at 1 M$\Omega$ and used to monitor the beam.
The opposite end of the optical fiber was affixed to a Thorlabs DET410 InGaAs
photodiode. The photodiode signal was amplified by a Femto HVA-200M-40-B voltage
amplifier before being sent to the oscilloscope. The time resolution of the
metastable measurements was determined by the InGaAs photodiode which had a
specified rise time of 5 ns.

In order to measure the absorption of the laser, it was first necessary to tune
the laser to the correct wavelength. This matter was complicated by the lack of
a wavemeter with sufficient precision and accuracy. As a result, a signal
generator was used to sweep the laser current so as to cover a frequency range
of 40 GHz while the plasma was operating. The temperature of the diode was then
slowly adjusted until absorption peaks corresponding to the 2$^3$S$_1$ -
2$^3$P$_{0,1,2}^\mathrm{o}$ transition were observed in the output of the InGaAs
photodiode. This allowed the laser current to be tuned to coincide with the
desired transition and provided a rough conversion between changes in the diode
current and changes in the laser wavelength. A more accurate measurement of this
relation was made with a CVI Melles Griot ET-25.4-10.00-30, solid dielectric
etalon. It was found that a temperature of 36$^\circ$ C and a current of 63 mA
produced resulted in an output wavelength of approximately 1082.9 nm and the
conversion between diode current and wavelength was $0.6067$ mA/GHz.

As described in Chapter~\ref{chp:experiment}, data acquisition was handled by a
LabView program, connected to the oscilloscope by a GPIB cable. The auxiliary
outputs of the SRS SR850 lock-in amplifier were used to adjust the diode laser
current (via the DCC 110 module), and to trigger the electronic shutter. One of
the auxiliary inputs of the lock-in amplifier was used to read out the pressure
from the pressure controller.

Data were acquired for a range of pressures from 0.3-16.0 Torr, and at three
axial locations: 5.08, 12.7, and 20.32 cm, relative to the glass-metal seal of
the anode. In reference to their location relative to the gas inlet these will
be referred to as the `upstream', `midstream', and `downstream' locations,
respectively. For each combination of location and pressure, absorption spectra
were measured over $\pm3.85$ GHz relative to the nominal transition frequency of
the 2$^3$S$_1$-2$^3$P$_0^\mathrm{o}$ transition at intervals of 154 MHz. The
absorption spectra were measured for time domains of $-300$-$1700$ ns relative
to the voltage pulse. Additional measurements were made at the midstream
position of the metastable densities from $-88$-$700$ $\mu$s in order to
investigate the loss mechanisms of the metastables.

The broadband electronic noise emitted by the fast pulses was a persistent issue
and presented one the greatest challenges in the acquisition of accurate
measurements. In order to reduce the noise present in the detector signal, the
InGaAs photodiode was removed from the immediate area surrounding the discharge
by the use of an optical fiber. The optical fiber was routed through a small
opening in a grounded metal box where both the photodiode and the voltage
amplifier resided. In addition, the DC power supply of the voltage amplifier was
connected to an outlet on a Tripp-lite Isobar intended to provide isolation for
the power input. The photodiode was connected directly to the input terminal of
the amplifier minimizing the length between the two. Likewise, the amplifier was
connected to a BNC bulkhead adapter by a 10 cm length of RG 50/U. The final
connection to the oscilloscope was made by an additional 10 cm length of RG
50/U, running from the BNC bulkhead connection.

Figure~\ref{fig:transmitted}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/metastables/figures/transmitted.eps}
  \caption{Measurement of the transmitted laser light at the nominal transition
  wavelength at 4.0 Torr of helium.}
  \label{fig:transmitted}
\end{figure}
shows the transmission signal measured at the nominal transition wavelength
while the plasma was active in 4.0 Torr of helium. The signal is an average of
200 independent pulses. Further sampling had no appreciable effect on the
waveform. As can be seen, despite the efforts to limit the electrical
interference, there is still a substantial amount of what is believed to be
noise present in the transmission signal. These features are believed to be
electrical noise as they exceed the bandwidth of the photodetector and exhibited
unpredictable variations between shots. This is most noticeable in the large
ringing which occurs for the first 200 ns after the voltage pulse. Without any
kind of compensation for this noise it would be impossible to obtain reliable
measurements of the transmission signal.

\section{Noise Suppression \& Absorption Analysis}

The noise produced by the \acs{rpnd} was relatively consistent between pulses as
well as over the duration of each experiment. As a result, it was possible to
correct for the electrical noise and emissions from other transitions by
measuring the signal from the photodiode in the absence of the laser and
subtracting this from the signal with the laser. The acquisition process
proceeded as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \singlespacing
  \item Set desired laser wavelength.
  \item Wait 5 s for laser output to settle.
  \item Acquire 200 waveforms from photodiode.
  \item Close shutter.
  \item Acquire 200 waveforms from photodiode.
  \item Repeat
\end{enumerate}
The effect of this subtraction can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:contours}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/metastables/figures/contours.eps}
  \caption{Heatmaps of the transmitted laser signal for the 4.0 Torr condition at 
  various stages of post-processing.}
  \label{fig:contours}
\end{figure}
where the top heatmap shows the initial set of acquisitions with the laser on,
and the middle heatmap shows the transmitted signal with the noise subtracted.

As the wavelength of the laser diode changed, so did the output power. This led
to the gradient-like appearance of the top two plots in
figure~\ref{fig:contours}. In order to correct for this a measurement was made
of the unattenuated laser power as a function of diode wavelength. This was done by
deactivating the plasma and repeating the above acquisition procedure. The
intensity of each point in the transmission spectra was then divided by the
unattenuated laser power, producing the properly normalized transmission
spectra.

These spectra were then analyzed using a transmission model based on the
absorption cross sections described in Chapter~\ref{chp:theory}. In a
one-dimensional system, the change in intensity of an incident photon field
(below the saturation limit), can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{dI(x, \omega)}{dx} = -\sigma(\omega) N(x) I(x, \omega)
\end{equation}
where $I$ is the intensity of the photon field as a function of distance $x$,
$\omega$ is the frequency of the photons, $N$ is the density of the interacting
species, and $\sigma$ is the interaction cross section. This equation has the
simple solution,
\begin{equation}
  T(\omega) = \frac{I(x, \omega)}{I_0(\omega)}
            = \exp\left[-\sigma(\omega) \int_0^x N(x') dx'\right],
  \label{eq:transmitted}
\end{equation}
where $T$ is the transmitted intensity fraction, and $I_0$ is the initial
intensity of the photon field. The absorption can be trivially obtained from the
relation $A(\omega) = 1 - T(\omega)$.

For the purpose of analyzing the absorption spectra, a quantity called the
line-integrated density will be defined. This is simply, $\nint = \int_0^x
N(x')dx'$. While equation~\ref{eq:absorb} can be used to determine the
absorption cross section it requires that a lineshape be specified. In general,
it is preferable to select either a purely Gaussian or purely Lorentzian
lineshape. This reduces the computational cost of spectral calculations in
comparison to the use of the Voigt profile (equation~\ref{eq:voigt}). Whether
the Voigt profile is necessitated or not can be determined by a comparison of
the relative widths of the different broadening mechanisms. For a temperature of
300 K and a pressure of 8.0 Torr, it is found that $\dwd = 1.7$ GHz and $\dwa =
0.21$ GHz. Because neither broadening mechanism appears dominant, the choice was
made to analyze the data with a Voigt profile, despite the added computational
cost.

Equations~\ref{eq:transmitted},~\ref{eq:absorb}, and~\ref{eq:voigt} can be
combined to form a model equation for the absorption spectrum. It can be seen
that only two unknowns exist: the gas temperature, $T_g$, and the
line-integrated density, $\nint$. The model equation was matched to the measured
spectrum at each time point using the Levenburg-Marquardt algorithm
\cite{Marquardt1963}, as implemented by the SciPy library \cite{Jones2001}.
During the matching process, small variations in the center frequency of the
laser diode were observed. This was assumed to be the result of long-term
variations in the diode temperature that were not adequately compensated for by
the temperature control system. The magnitude of these drifts were on the order
of $\pm60$ MHz between experiments. This fluctuation in center frequency was
measured for each experiment and use to correct the wavelengths in the
post-processing. A full report and code listing for the laser analysis software
is presented in Appendix~\ref{chp:lasana}.

Prior to the absorption measurements, the laser power was measured with a
Newport thermopile sensor (818P-001-12) calibrated at 1064 nm in conjunction
with a Newport 2832-C power meter. This allowed the selection of an appropriate
neutral density filter in order to remain below the two-level saturation limit.
To ensure that the actual intensity was below the saturation limit, two
preliminary absorption measurements were made of the line-integrated density at
the midstream position of the \acs{rpnd} operating at 4.0 Torr. The first
measurement was for the nominal laser intensity. The second measurement used a
second neutral density filter which reduced this intensity by an order of
magnitude. The results are compared in figure~\ref{fig:saturation}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/metastables/figures/saturation.eps}
  \caption{Test for saturation in laser-absorption signal. The red curve shows
    the integrated density for an intensity ten times larger than the black
    curve.}
  \label{fig:saturation}
\end{figure}
with the nominal intensity in red and the reduced intensity in black. If
saturation was present in the system, the integrated density would be expected
to increase for the reduced laser intensity. Instead, the two curves are
essentially the same within the variance estimated by the analysis routine.

\section{Results}

The matching algorithm proved robust enough to automatically match the
transmission spectrum at each time step with no user intervention.
Figure~\ref{fig:matching}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/metastables/figures/matching.eps}
  \caption{Comparison of the measured transmission profile (open symbols) and
  the computer-generated matches for at several different times for the 4.0 Torr
  operating condition.}
  \label{fig:matching}
\end{figure}
shows three examples of the measured transmission spectra along with the
computer-generated matches. The measured data cleanly coalesce to complete
transmission far from the peak. In addition, the spectra show no evidence of the
noise caused by the discharge. This suggests that the compensation described in
the previous section was adequate for these conditions. Across all cases, the
total variation in the baseline transmission signal was approximately 0.02. This
set a minimum line-integrated detection limit of approximately $3.0 \times
10^{14}$ m$^{-2}$ (about $9.1\times10^{15}$ m$^{-3}$ for a radially uniform
distribution of metastable atoms), though the actual value varied with respect
to the pressure and temperature.

\subsection{Temperatures}

The temperatures calculated for the metastables from the laser-absorption
spectroscopy diagnostic are shown in figure~\ref{fig:temperatures}.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/metastables/figures/temperatures.eps}
  \caption{Plot of the gas temperatures at each of the operating
  pressures and each axial location as a function of time.}
  \label{fig:temperatures}
\end{figure}
Prior to the pulse, the temperature estimates are subject to large variations.
This is a result of the relatively low metastable densities which precede the
pulse. Without a substantial metastable population, the matching algorithm had
difficulty discriminating between a combination of low temperatures and low
densities (a small, narrow absorption spectrum) versus high temperatures and
high densities (a very broad absorption spectrum).

Though it is not possible to provide an exact value of the errors in the
calculated temperatures, the algorithm does provide an estimate of the standard
deviation in its results. In all cases, the estimated standard deviation was less
than 10 K by the end of the measurement period. Given this value, there appear
to be no meaningful trends throughout the measurement period, and between the
measurement locations.

In order to more clearly compare the temperatures at the different operating
conditions, the results for each location were combined and averaged over the
final 200 ns. This was then plotted with respect to the energy deposition
calculations from Chapter~\ref{chp:experiment}, divided by the gas density. If
the discharge was appreciably heating the helium, the temperature would be
expected to increase with respect to the density-normalized energy deposition.
As seen in figure~\ref{fig:tvp}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/metastables/figures/tvp.eps}
  \caption{Plot of the average gas temperature as a function of deposited
  energy normalized by the neutral gas pressure.}
  \label{fig:tvp}
\end{figure}
this does not appear to be the case. Indeed, most of the operating conditions
show little to no statistical difference between each other and room
temperature. The only exception to this is the 16.0 Torr operating condition
with a mean temperature of 255 K. As no effort was made to cool the discharge
tube, this appears to be an erroneous result. A comparison of the calculated
spectra and the original absorption spectra revealed no obvious errors. However,
as will be seen later, the metastables were the least dense at 16.0 Torr. This,
along with the large variation of the temperatures between time points suggest
that the standard deviation in the calculations is higher than estimated. 

Only a limited number of similar direct temperature measurements exist within
the literature. The work of Walsh et al. \cite{Walsh2010} provides the most
direct comparison. In their study, they measured the heating in a planar
discharge with helium and a small admixture of oxygen as the working gas. The
system was held at atmospheric pressure and had a gas flow rate of 5 slm.
Instead of absorption spectroscopy, the rotational spectra of the oxygen was
used to determine the temperature. Temperatures ranged from 300-340 K, depending
on the average power dissipated in the plasma. Walsh et al.\ suggested that the
observed temperature increase was a result of Joule heating, that is, heating of
the gas as a result of electrons colliding with neutral particles. As this
process scales with density, it would not be expected to be present in the
trends from figure~\ref{fig:tvp}. The presence of a measurable fraction of a
molecular gas (oxygen) Walsh et al.'s work allows for several other heating
mechanisms to occur. Dissociation of the oxygen can impart translational energy
to the daughter particles, heating the gas. Additionally, excited the energy
contained in rotational and (to a lesser extent) vibrational states can be
converted to translational energy in collisions \cite{Kiehlbauch2003}.

Other experiments have demonstrated minimal gas heating for \acs{rpnd}s. Plasma
bullets, like those of Laroussi and Lu \cite{Laroussi2005, Lu2006}, tend to be
associated with minimal heating. However, others have observed measurable
heating with temperatures ranging from 400-1000 K \cite{Pai2009, Popov2011,
Zuzeek2010, Aleksandrov2010} (see appendix~\ref{chp:nasa} for detailed study in
air at NASA Glenn Research Center). A comparison of the experimental conditions
shows that heating was only observed in molecular gases, though there were cases
in which no heating was observed \cite{Pancheshnyi2000}, likely a result of the
low repetition rate and energy deposition. These similarities emphasize the
importance of the additional heating pathways linked to molecular gases.

For comparison recent simulations and rate calculations \cite{Takashima2011,
Aleksandrov2007} have provided estimates of the electron temperature in the
range of 10-20 eV. As a result, all of the discharges mentioned are very much
nonthermal in nature. That said, the negligible heating in the helium \acs{rpnd}
studied here may provide a significant advantage in some applications, as even
the moderate temperature increases in molecular discharges can threaten material
integrity. For example, most commercial polymers are only rated to 300$^\circ$
C, making them susceptible to damage without careful thermal management.

\subsection{Line-integrated Densities}

As described in the analysis section, the laser-absorption spectroscopy also
yielded the line-integrated metastable densities. Figure~\ref{fig:metastables}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/metastables/figures/metastables.eps}
  \caption{Plots of the line-integrated metastable densities at each of
  the operating pressures and each axial location as a function of
  time.}
  \label{fig:metastables}
\end{figure}
shows the metastables dynamics for each operating pressure and at each location.
Similar to the temperature measurements, there is a substantial uncertainty
during the pre-pulse period for pressures greater than 1.0 Torr. However, for
1.0 Torr and below, there are detectable populations of triplet metastables,
around $7\times10^{14}$ m$^{-2}$ ($2.1\times10^{16}$ m$^{-3}$ for a radially
uniform distribution). These excited atoms are the remnants of the previous
pulses which have not been destroyed or left the system. Despite the efforts
made to limit the noise in the signals, there is a significant number of
erroneous data points in the downstream measurements for pressures below 3.0
Torr. It is not clear why this measurement location was particularly susceptible
to plasma-related noise. In all cases, the photodiode remained in the grounded
enclosure and only optical components were moved.

In each case, the metastable population exhibits two short jumps at 140 and 280
ns. This is shown in more detail in figure~\ref{fig:mzoomed}.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/metastables/figures/mzoomed.eps}
  \caption{Zoomed in view of the increases in metastable density as a result of
    pulse reflections.}
  \label{fig:mzoomed}
\end{figure}
The timing of these bursts correlate with the arrival of pulse reflections.
This suggests that the even after the plasma has formed, additional pulses are
still able to deposit a significant amount of energy in the plasma. This appears
to contradict the predictions made by the one-dimensional drift models of
Adamovich et al. \cite{Adamovich2009} and Nikandrov et al. \cite{Nikandrov2008}
which stated that little energy is coupled into the plasma after breakdown
occurs. In addition to the smaller bursts in density, another can be noted at
about 900 ns which corresponds to the double-pulsing observed in the
current-voltage characteristics of Chapter~\ref{chp:experiment}.

By 200 ns after the pulse, the estimated standard deviation in all cases is
approximately $2\times10^{14}$ m$^{-2}$. Based on this, it can be concluded that
the metastable populations had no significant axial dependence below 8.0 Torr.
However, both 8.0 and 16.0 Torr conditions showed notable differences in the
metastable population as a function of distance from the anode. As might be
expected, the upstream location (closest to the anode) has a high metastable
population than the other two. At 16.0 Torr, the line-integrated density at the
upstream location was over twice that of either location.

This behavior is reminiscent of that observed by Vasilyak et al.
\cite{Vasilyak1994} in \acs{fiw} devices. It was noted that the electric field
of the wave would attenuate with distance. In order to interpret this, they
considered the wave to consist of two components: a moving ionization front with
a finite width, and the plasma left in its wake. They state that the plasma,
with its finite conductivity, will have some voltage drop across it, and as it
grows, this drop increases. As a result the voltage drop across the ionization
front can never be greater than the overall potential applied to the system and
is constantly diminishing as it moves away from the energized electrode. If
true, this behavior would be associated with a reduction in the rate of
metastable generation in the front, thus explaining the high pressure data in
figure~\ref{fig:metastables}.

\end{table}

Similar measurements were made by Stevefelt, Pouvesle, and Bouchoule
\cite{Pouvesle1988} in an atmospheric-pressure discharge with an input energy of
0.2 J. This discharge produced a peak metastable density of $4.8\times10^{14}$
cm$^{-3}$. If the discharge is assumed to produce a cylindrical plasma, the
energy required to generate each atom can be estimated as 29.7 eV. For
comparison, if the peak metastable density of the present \acs{rpnd}
($1.1\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$) is assumed to fill the volume of the glass tube,
the metastable energy cost is about 143 eV/atom. Despite the assumptions related
to the plasma geometry and difference in operating pressure, these two values
are comparable.

Though other metastable measurements of similar helium discharges exist, most do
not provide estimates of the energy deposition, or possess poorly defined
geomtries. As a result, it is impossible to make the same comparison as in the
case of Stevefelt, Pouvesle, and Bouchoule. That said, Urabe et al.
\cite{Urabe2010} measured metastable densities of up to $4\times10^{11}$
cm$^{-3}$ with laser-absorption spectroscopy in a helium jet at atmospheric
pressure. Nersisyan, Morrow, and Graham made measurements suggesting a
metastable density of about $1.5\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ in a \acs{dbd}
\cite{Nersisyan2004}. Though the discharge was not pulsed, Millard et al.\
measured densities from $5\times10^9$ - $1.2\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ in helium
glow at 2.0 and 5.0 Torr \cite{Millard1998}. While none of these experiments are
a direct comparison, they do suggest that the results obtained above are within
reason.

\subsection{Metastable Destruction}

In addition to the fast metastable dynamics, measurements were made of the
long-term trends of the metastable populations. Afterglow measurements such as
these are less subject to the noise and bandwidth limitations of the short
timescale measurements. This makes it possible to obtain relatively clean and
precise values for the metastable densities. However, without the applied
electric field, the nonequilibrium dynamics of the system rapidly disappear.
Therefore, while these measurements provide some insight on the initial
conditions and the post-pulse dynamics, they cannot describe the changes which
occur during the onset of a pulse in the \acs{rpnd}.

That said, a large body of work has been conducted on helium afterglow
discharges, which makes this regime attractive as a point of comparison.
Furthermore, these measurements include the peak metastable populations for each
operating pressure (which are missing from figure~\ref{fig:metastables}). The
peak metastable densities and the lifetime of the metastable populations are of
interest as they can produce charged particles through Penning ionization of
each other or impurities \cite{Nersisyan2004}. This extends the ionization
period in rare gas \acs{rpnd}s well past the voltage pulse itself. Also, as seen
in figure~\ref{fig:grotrian}, all excited states in the triplet manifold will
eventually decay to the triplet metastable level. Thus, a substantial portion of
the energy deposited in the plasma is contained in this one level.

Figure~\ref{fig:long}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/metastables/figures/long.eps}
  \caption{Measurements of the long-duration metastable density trends.

  \label{fig:long}
\end{figure}
contains logarithmic plots of the metastable populations for each operating
condition, all measured at the midstream location. In addition, an exponential
function was fit to the tail of each trend, represented by the dotted line. On
these time scales, the destruction of metastables in the \acs{rpnd} apparatus
can be described by four different mechanisms: diffusion, Penning ionization of
impurities, Penning ionization between metastables, and three-body collisions
resulting in helium dimer formation. All processes with the exception of the
Penning ionization between metastables have an exponential dependence, thus any
deviation from an exponential decay is likely a result of Penning ionization
\cite{Deloche1976}.

As can be seen, a number of the decay curves deviate from a strictly exponential
decline. This deviation appears to be more substantial at the lower pressures.
For example, the decay at 16.0 Torr appears strictly exponential. Initially,
this deviation was believed to be the result of Penning ionization between
metastables. The rate at which this takes place is proportional to the square of
the metastable density. Therefore, if this is the process responsible for these
deviations, it should be most severe for the highest metastable densities.
However, per figure~\ref{fig:peaknm},
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/metastables/figures/peaknm.eps}
  \caption{Peak line-integrated metastable densities as a function of pressure.}
  \label{fig:peaknm}
\end{figure}
this is not the case. If Penning ionization between metastables were the
dominant loss mechanism, it would be reduced at the lower pressure conditions,
contrary to what was observed.

Ultimately, the behavior of the metastable populations in the afterglow can be
best understood by a comparison of the depopulation rates for each process.
Figure~\ref{fig:decay}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/metastables/figures/decay.eps}
  \caption{Comparison of the decay rates for diffusion, Penning ionization of
    nitrogen, Penning ionization between metastables, and molecular conversion at
    0.3 Torr as a function of metastable density.}
  \label{fig:decay}
\end{figure}
illustrates the aforementioned decay processes at 0.3 Torr, for a variety of
metastable densities. The rate constants for these processes were obtained from
the study by Deloche et al.~\cite{Deloche1976} and the work of Pouvesle et
al.~\cite{Pouvesle1988} (specifically for the rate of Penning ionization of
nitrogen impurities). The gas impurities were assumed to be nitrogen, and the
mole fraction was assumed to be 80 ppm, as was estimated in
Chapter~\ref{chp:experiment}.

As can be seen, the dominant loss mechanism above metastable densities of
$2\times10^{17}$ m$^{-3}$ was Penning ionization between two metastable atoms.
Also important, but not shown, are losses resulting from super-elastic electron
collisions. Electron density measurements made by Weatherford et
al.~\cite{Weatherford2012} indicate that the electron density is comparable to
the metastable density. Likewise, the rate coefficient for super-elastic
electron collisions from Pouvesle et al.~\cite{Pouvesle1988} is of the same
order as the Penning ionization between metastables.

At lower densities and higher pressures the three-body, molecular conversion
process responsible for dimer formation was dominant. However, this process
scales with the square of the neutral gas pressure. As a result, as the pressure
is increased this mechanism quickly overtakes the others. This severely
restricts the longevity of the metastable states at higher pressures, and
reduces their ability to prolong the charged particle population.

From figures~\ref{fig:decay} and~\ref{fig:long}, it can be seen that, aside from
the deviations at lower pressures, the decay curves are well-matched by the
exponential functions. As a result, it is possible to use the fitting functions
to estimate the pre-pulse metastable densities as a function of pressure. These
estimates are consistent with the short-scale measurements from
figure~\ref{fig:metastables}. The estimated values of the pre-pulse metastable
densities are compiled in table~\ref{tbl:prepulse}.

\end{table}
along with the decay constants. These results show reasonable agreement with the
earlier pre-pulse metastable densities, and are within a factor of two or less.
This supports the previous measurements, and provides some confidence that the
other extrapolations are also accurate representations of the pre-pulse
metastable densities.

The decay constants are about an order of magnitude larger than those recorded
by Phelps and Molnar \cite{Phelps1953} at similar pressures. This almost
certainly reflects the presence of the impurities in the system.
Figure~\ref{fig:decay} shows that impurities are a moderate contributor to the
decay of the metastable atoms even at low pressures. Similar measurements and
calculations by Deloche et al.~\cite{Deloche1976} confirm the lower decay
constants of Phelps and Molnar. In addition, their results showed a relatively
consistent proportionality between the electron density and metastable density
(on the order of one for every ten). Therefore, these density values may be read
as a rough approximation of the electron densities within the \acs{rpnd}.

\section{Summary}
A laser diode-based absorption spectroscopy experiment was set up to observe the
development of the \acs{rpnd} on short (0-1700 ns) and long (0-700 $\mu$s) time
scales. The measurements on the short time scale provide some of the only
detailed measurements of the \acs{rpnd} during its development. The design of
the system and post-processing software carefully accounted for plasma-related
noise, background emissions, and laser drift. The absorption spectra model
showed excellent agreement with the measured spectra and the matching algorithm
produced consistent and reliable results almost all cases.

Temperature measurements from the Doppler broadening of the absorption spectra
showed no appreciable gas heating at any operating pressure. These results
contrast with some measurements made in molecular \acs{rpnd}s where a variety of
additional mechanisms are available to transfer kinetic energy from electrons to
heavier species.

The line-integrated density results indicate that the plasma is axially uniform
across the tube at lower pressures. The 8.0 and 16.0 Torr conditions
show significant attenuation in the metastable densities as a function of
distance from the anode. This may present a geometric limit to the use of
similar \acs{rpnd}s in material processing. The dominant metastable loss
mechanism at low pressures and short time periods is Penning ionization between
metastables. However, losses are eventually dominated by three-body dimer
formation for all cases. Peak metastable generation is optimized at 4.0 Torr.
However, the peak pre-pulse metastable densities, and possibly the electron
densities, are optimized at 1.0 Torr. Interestingly, this corresponds with the
maximum measured energy deposition from Chapter~\ref{chp:experiment}.

These measurements provide an important foundation upon which to develop a more
encompassing perspective of how the \acs{rpnd} develops. Specifically, the
generation of the metastable atoms is related to a number of other plasma
parameters, including: electron density, electron temperature, \acs{eedf}, and
electric field. Provided a sufficiently detailed model, it should be possible to
capture these relationships, and use the measured metastable densities to infer
the evolution of these quantities as well as other excited states in the system.
