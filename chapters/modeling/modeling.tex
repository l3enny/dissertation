Though the metastable density measurements appear to be one of only a few
diagnositics conducted during the development of the \acs{rpnd}, they only
provide a limited view of the energy transport in the discharge. Quantities,
such as the ions, electrons, additional excited states, and fields all evolve in
time along with the metastable population. However, the gas phase excitation and
emission processes are closely related and provided a sufficiently detailed
model, it should be possible to infer some or all of these parameters during the
development of the \acs{rpnd}. The ideal model would solve
equation~\ref{eq:boltzmann}, the Boltzmann equation for each species, over the
entire geometry, for all velocities, for as long as required to reach
equilibrium.

Unfortunately, these requirements are somewhat problematic. Solutions of the
Boltzmann equation for a single species are difficult \cite{Lieberman2005}, not
withstanding for the dozens of species which may be present in the \acs{rpnd}.

If the system is spatially discretized with a grid spacing on the order of a
Debye length (about 20 $\mu$m for the \acs{rpnd}), a Debye cube of this
dimension has a total volume of 8$\times10^{-15}$ m$^3$. This suggests the need
for approximately 3.2$\times10^{10}$ cells for the \acs{rpnd} in question.
Assuming that each dimension of velocity space is discretized into 100
components, a total of 0.26 exabytes would be required to describe a single
species in the \acs{rpnd} at each timestep. This storage requirement can be
relaxed if a reduction in spatial or velocity resolution is acceptable, however
even moderate simplifications possess non-trivial computing requirements.

\section{Model Development}

Therefore, some approximations of the Boltzmann equation were required in order
to obtain a computationally tractable problem. As discussed in
Chapter~\ref{chp:theory}, the most common approach, and the one applied here, is
the use of \emph{moments} of the Boltzmann equation. The moments represent an
average over the velocity-space of the Boltzmann equation, resulting in
macroscopic properties and relations, such as the continuity equation. They are
often used to develop various fluid approximations for plasmas \cite{Chen1984}
(e.g.\ the two fluid model and the magnetohydrodynamic equations). Fluid models
have been tremendously successful in the description of everything from plasma
display panels \cite{Rauf1999b} to interstellar plasmas \cite{Linde1998}.

The use of moments of the Boltzmann equation does introduce some additional
problems. Reaction rates, such as those which describe ionization and
excitation, are sensitive to changes in the distribution of particle velocities.
However, the distribution velocity of particles is determined from the solution
of the Boltzmann equation. As a result, a distribution function either be
generated by an approximate solution of the Boltzmann equation
\cite{Hagelaar2005} or assumed from a equilibrium solution of Boltzmann
equation, such as the Maxwell-Boltzmann and Druyvesteyn distributions from
Chapter~\ref{chp:theory}. The choice of which approach to use is not easy as the
\acs{eedf} is rarely known \emph{a priori}. Consequently, this topic is
considered more thoroughly in section~\ref{sec:dists}.

Despite the simplification in velocity-space, the resulting fluid models can
still be computationally demanding for large geometries. This has motivated the
development of models which reduce the geometric complexity of the system in
order to address a larger number of species and transitions
\cite{Lieberman2005}. In the extreme case, the geometric dependence of the
solutions can be completely eliminated by assuming some sort of spatial
distribution.

Several \acs{fiw} studies were found to have successfully applied these ``global
models'' to their systems \cite{Aleksandrov2007, Popov2011}. By the elimination
of the geometric discretization, they were able to consider a large number of
species and reaction pathways. In this work, a global model was used to simulate
the \acs{rpnd}. The final model tracked a total of 32 different excited states
of helium from 50 ns prior to the pulse to 140 ns after the pulse (just prior to
the first reflection). Between these possible states a total of 535 different
reaction processes were incorporated including electron-related reactions,
radiative processes, and inter-atomic interactions.

In order to compare the metastable measurements to the global model predictions,
it was necessary to convert the line-integrated densities from
Chapter~\ref{chp:metastables} to volumetric densities, along the path of the
laser. It has been noted that a similar \acs{fiw} \cite{Vasilyak1994} and the
same \acs{rpnd} \cite{Weatherford2012} exhibited radial variations in emission
intensity, electron density, and metastable density. Unfortunately, the cause of
these variations is not clearly understood. It has been suggested that
high-energy electrons from the walls may be responsible \cite{Weatherford2012a}.
However, lacking any empirical, theoretical, or numerical results with which
describe the evolution of the radial profile during the discharge, the
metastable distribution was simply assumed to be uniform. This assumption likely
affects the inferred plasma parameters, however more accurate results are
possible provided time-resolved measurements of the radial metastable density or
an improved understanding of the \acs{rpnd}.

\subsection{Continuity Equation}

Equation~\ref{eq:cont}, the continuity equation, forms the basis for tracking
the populations of the excited states in the plasma. Eliminating the spatial
gradients reduces this to,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d n_\alpha}{dt} = G_\alpha - L_\alpha,
  \label{eq:zdmcont}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ identifies the particle species, $G$ is the gain term, and $L$ is
the loss term. The gain and loss terms represent all possible reactions which
can alter the population of $\alpha$. The model presented incorporates helium
states up to $n=4$ (see table~\ref{tbl:states}),

helium ions, and electrons. It should also be noted that the experimental
measurements suggested the presence of air impurities up to 80 ppm, and helium
dimers are also likely present in the experimental discharge
\cite{Pouvesle1988}. However, they were neglected in the case of this model. As
observed in Chapter~\ref{chp:metastables}, the total e-folding time for the
metastable decay was approximately 25 $\mu$s. This indicates that the processes
associated with the dimers and impurities are irrelevant on the sub-microsecond
time scale.

There were several possible processes that were considered for inclusion in the
model:
\begin{itemize}
  \singlespacing
  \item electron impact ionization,
  \item electron impact (de)excitation,
  \item atomic impact (de)excitation,
  \item atomic excitation transfer,
  \item dielectronic recombination,
  \item three-body recombination,
  \item radiative decay, and
  \item diffusion.
\end{itemize}
As with the impurities and dimer formation, diffusion occurs on a much longer
time scale, and was subsequently neglected. Three-body recombination in the
volume of the discharge is not important at the estimated temperatures and
densities \cite{Lieberman2005}, therefore this too was neglected. In general,
dielectronic recombination is a rare process \cite{Nahar2010}, however it was
incorporated in early versions of the model and was subsequently retained. The
importance of ground state excitation or ionization is generally small as the
kinetic energy of an atom cannot be easily transferred to the orbital electron
\cite{Lieberman2005}.

While inter-atomic collisions of excited states can result in a redistribution
of excited states or ionization, these processes are not significant in the
\acs{rpnd} as the reaction rates are proportional to the product of two
(relatively small) excited state densities. The most dominant excited-excited
interaction is associative ionization by metastable states \cite{Deloche1976}.
Based on the rates reported in by Deloche et al.\ and the measured metastable
densities, associative ionization could be expected to change the metastable
density by less than 0.1\% over the course of the 140 ns simulation period.

The remaining processes were found to be the most important for the \acs{rpnd}.
This included electron-impact ionization and excitation which dominated the
short time-scale dynamics. In addition, excitation transfer between atoms was
found to occur at rates relevant to the simulation period \cite{Lieberman2005}.
Likewise, radiative decay occurred fast enough relative to the simulation period
to necessitate inclusion \cite{Kramida2012}.

For these processes, equation~\ref{eq:zdmcont} was rewritten as,
\begin{multline}
  \frac{dN_i}{dt} =   n_e \left[       \sum_{j\neq i} N_j K^e_{j,i}(T_e) 
                                 - N_i \sum_{j\neq i}     K^e_{i,j}(T_e) \right]
                        + \left[       \sum_{j > i}   N_j K^o_{j,i} 
                                 - N_i \sum_{j < i}       K^o_{i,j}      \right] \\
                    + N_g \left[       \sum_{j\neq i} N_j K^a_{j,i} 
                                 - N_i \sum_{j\neq i}     K^a_{i,j}      \right].
  \label{eq:gcont}
\end{multline}
Here, the subscripts of $i$ and $j$ represent different states of helium, $N$ is
the state density, $K$ is a rate coefficient, $T_e$ is the electron temperature,
and $N_g$ is the neutral helium density. The first subscript of the rate
coefficients represents the initial excited state while the second coefficient
represents the final excited state. Therefore, $K_{ij}$ is a rate coeficient for
a process that transfers an atom from state $i$ to state $j$.

The equation is split into three sets of processes, represented by the
superscripts of the rate coefficients: $e$ - electron impact processes, $o$ -
radiative decay, and $a$ - atomic excitation transfer. Therefore, the first
bracketed term on the right hand side contains all the rate coefficients for
electron impact excitation and de-excitation (including ionization). The second
bracketed term contains the rate coefficients for optical transitions in and out
of the excited state. The final bracketed term contains the gains and losses as
a result of excitation transfer caused by collisions with the ground state.

The rate coefficients in equation~\ref{eq:gcont} are compiled from a number of
different sources. The optical transition rates and the energies of each level
were obtained from the NIST Atomic Spectra Database \cite{Kramida2012}. The
excitation transfer rate coefficients came from the studies of Catherinot and
Dubreuil \cite{Catherinot1981, Dubreuil1980}. Coefficients were only available
for the transitions with $\Delta n=0$ and $n=3,4$. No constants were found for
other excitation transfer reactions. The dielectronic recombination rates were
adapted from the work of Nahar \cite{Nahar2010}.

The semi-empirical relations derived by Ralchenko et al. \cite{Ralchenko2008}
were used to calculate the electron (de)excitation and ionization cross sections
(including multi-step ionization) for levels through $n=4$. At the time of this
writing, these are the most accurate set of cross sections available for neutral
helium with a quoted accuracy of 10-30\% for $\Delta S=0$, and $>30$\% for
$\Delta S \neq 0$. Only reactions resulting in an energetically uphill reaction
were tabulated. The inverse or superelastic cross sections were calculated using
the principle of detailed balance \cite{Kunze2009},
\begin{equation}
  \sigma_{ji}(\epsilon) = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon - \Delta\epsilon_{ij}}
    \frac{g_j^2}{g_i}\sigma_{ij},
\end{equation}
where $\Delta\epsilon$ is the threshold energy of the $ij$ reaction and $g$ is
the statistical degeneracy of the corresponding state. These cross sections can
be used to calculate the rate coefficients for each reaction using
equation~\ref{eq:rate}. However, this equation requires an appropriate
\acs{eedf} and leads back to the topic of which one is appropriate for the
\acs{rpnd}.

\subsection{Distribution Effects}\label{sec:dists}

Per the discussion of the Boltzmann equation in Chapter~\ref{chp:theory}, there
are two analytic equilibrium solutions: the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and
the Druyvesteyn distribution. However, research by Starikovskaia and
Starikovskii \cite{Starikovskaia2001a} has shown that the \acs{eedf} in a
nitrogen \acs{fiw} can deviate from both. This is not surprising given the
non-equilibrium nature of the \acs{fiw} discharge. Since the \acs{rpnd} shares
many of its properties, there was the possibility that the equilibrium solutions
would not apply to the \acs{rpnd} either.

In order to better understand the energy distributions in a \acs{rpnd}, a
numerical study of the \acs{eedf} in a helium \acs{rpnd} was conducted. First, a
particle-in-cell (\acs{pic}) code was used to simulate the effect of a voltage
pulse on electrons in a quasi zero-dimensional geometry. This generated an
evolution of the \acs{eedf} in a helium plasma as a function of time. Then, the
mean energy for the \acs{eedf} was calculated for a series of time steps. These
values were then used to generate equivalent Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions and
approximate solutions of the Boltzmann equation.

A \acs{pic} simulation uses a different approach to solve the Boltzmann
equation. A \acs{pic} code simulates the behavior of many plasma particles in an
experimental geometry using the basic laws of motion and electromagnetism
\cite{Birdsall1991}. A discrete \acs{eedf} can then be calculated from the
particle population (or subset thereof). As the number of simulated particles
increases the discrete \acs{eedf} will approach the continuous \acs{eedf} which
would result from a solution of the Boltzmann equation. The relative small
number of approximations used in \acs{pic} simulations allow them to fully
capture the collisionless plasma dynamics \cite{Pritchett2003} while the
accuracy of the collisional processes is dependent on the of Monte Carlo
techniques.

Generally, \acs{pic} simulations do not use a one-to-one correspondence between
computer particles and physical particles--most plasmas involve more particles
than can be reasonably simulated. Instead, they treat a population of
macro-particles, each of which possesses some statistical weight
\cite{Birdsall1991}. This allows the macro-particle to represent a group of
physical particles. The macro-particles each possess velocities and positions
which are continuous within the limits of floating point representation.
However, the electromagnetic fields are spatially discretized. This necessitates
a mapping of the particle-related fields to the discretized coordinates, and the
force of the fields from the discretized coordinates to the particles.

Each \acs{pic} simulation begins with a definition of the system geometry and
the external fields. Some specified number of macro-particles with a known
distribution of velocities are then placed within this geometry. After these
steps have been completed, the physics loop, illustrated in
figure~\ref{fig:pic},
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{./chapters/modeling/figures/pic.tex}
  \caption{Schematic description of the \acs{pic} simulation process, adapted
    from \cite{Birdsall1991}.}
  \label{fig:pic}
\end{figure}
begins. The equations in the loop reflect a one-dimensional system, thus each
macro particle possesses only one spatial component, $x$. However, the
simulation supposes the existence of a magnetic field which induces motion
perpendicular to the simulation domain. Thus, each macro-particle must possess a
velocity vector, $\vec{v}$, with three components. While all the necessary
bookkeeping is done to track the velocity vector of the particle in all three
dimensions, the particle's position is only calculated in one.

The loop generally begins with an initial field calculation based on the
external fields combined with that of the particles. This is followed by a
particle ``push'' where the Lorentz equation, $\vec{F} = q(\vec{E} +
\vec{v}\times\vec{B})$, is used to calculate a new position for a given time
step, $\Delta t$. Afterward, particles which have moved out of the boundaries of
the system are removed from the simulation. Next, collisions (including
ionization and excitation) are modeled using Monte Carlo methods
\cite{Birdsall1991}. Finally, the fields of the macro-particles are mapped to
the spatial grid, the total fields are recalculated, and the next time step
begins.

The XPDP1 code, developed by Verboncoeur et al. \cite{Verboncoeur1993}, was used
for the \acs{pic} simulations. The code was originally designed to simulate a
one-dimensional discharge between two parallel electrodes. However, collection
at these electrodes complicated the study of the \acs{eedf} and did not
correspond well to the zero-dimensional nature of the global model. Charged
particle collection near the boundaries induced spatial variations in the
\acs{eedf}. Additionally, the high mobility of electrons often meant that they
were preferentially collected on short time scales. This led to the formation
of large regions of positive space charge which shielded the plasma from the
applied electric field.

In order to address these issues, the code was modified to use periodic boundary
conditions. Such conditions resulted in a quasi zero-dimensional simulation,
equivalent to a plasma of infinite extent. This eliminated the issue of spatial
variations in the \acs{eedf} and was more consistent with the assumptions that
led to the development of the global model. The XPDP1 code was further modified
in order to include downsampling once the maximum particle population was
reached. This the \acs{eedf} dynamics to be tracked from the seed electron
population a substantial ionization fraction.

Previous measurements of the electric field in a similar \acs{fiw} found that
the electric field values varied from 0-350 Td \cite{Takashima2011}. Based on
these results, it was decided to examine the distribution characteristics over
the range of 10-600 Td. In each case, the electric field was applied from the
start of the simulation. Though the actual field in the \acs{rpnd} has a finite
rise and fall, the use of an impulse field exacerbated non-equilibrium
characteristics of the \acs{eedf}. Therefore, the results of these \acs{pic}
simulations would overestimate deviations from equilibrium solutions of the
Boltzmann equation.

Helium gas was used as the background gas and was kept at a pressure of 2.0 Torr
for all simulations. An initial plasma was assumed to exist within the volume
with a density of $1.0\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$. The plasma was considered
quasineutral (equal numbers of ions and electrons), and with the number of
computational particles per physical particle varying according to the
downsampling. The total number of particles in the simulation was limited to
$1\times10^5$. Electrons were initialized with a thermal energy of 2.0 eV, and
the helium ions were given an initial energy of 0.025 eV (equal to room
temperature).

XPDP1's internal set of cross sections were used. These included:
elastic scattering, atomic excitation, and charge exchange. The cross
sections had a semi-empirical form which increased linearly with energy
until a peak value was reached. The electron-collision cross sections
are plotted in figure~\ref{fig:xsecs}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/modeling/figures/xsecs.eps}
  \caption{Internal set of helium cross sections from the XPDP1 code.}
  \label{fig:xsecs}
\end{figure}
After the peak they declined as the logarithm of the energy, divided by
the energy \cite{Verboncoeur1993}. The spatial domain of the code was 10
cm, discretized at 1 $\mu$m intervals.

The time domain of the simulation was 25 ns which corresponds to the length of
the applied pulse. The combination of this duration with the top hat-shaped
pulse should exhibit the most anisotropic \acs{eedf} which can be expected in
the \acs{rpnd}. A time step of $4\times10^{-13}$ s was used to satisfy the
Courant-Friedrich-Lewy (\acs{cfl}) stability condition. This condition requires
that particles not traverse more than one grid cell during each time step.
Failure to meet this condition leads to numerical instabilities in the
simulation.

BOLSIG+ was used to obtain the approximate solutions of the Boltzmann equation
\cite{Hagelaar2005}. BOLSIG+ is a publicly available computer code which uses
the two-term expansion of the Boltzmann equation to solve for the equilibrium
\acs{eedf} in a given electric field. The basis for this approach is the
realization that, within a uniform electric field, the distribution function can
be expressed as a series of spherical harmonics. For a sufficiently small
electric field and diffusion gradient \cite{Holstein1946}, the expansion can be
truncated after the first two terms. This expansion begins to fail at larger
fields \cite{Allis1982} and, for the cross sections used below, BOLSIG+ failed
to converge for field values greater than 1000 Td.

The solver was initialized with the same cross section set as the XPDP1 code.
Due to the nature of BOLSIG+, inter-atomic reactions (such as charge exchange
and elastic scattering) are not included. The temporal growth model for
electrons was used, and the electron-electron collisions were neglected as a
result of the low ionization fraction in the \acs{rpnd} (about 10$^{-5}$). The
\acs{eedf} was calculated for a range of mean energies from 2-50 eV at intervals
of 0.25 eV. \acs{eedf}s for intermediate mean energies were calculated by
interpolation of \acs{eedf}s for the two closest mean energies. This process was
somewhat complicated by the adaptive energy mesh used by BOLSIG+ necessitating
the use of a triangle-based cubic interpolation method \cite{Jones2001}.

These same energies were used to determine equivalent Maxwell-Boltzmann
distributions for comparison. The \acs{eedf}s generated by the \acs{pic}
simulations, approximate Boltzmann solutions, and Maxwell-Boltzmann
distributions can be seen in figures~\ref{fig:picmb1} and~\ref{fig:picmb2},
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/modeling/figures/picmb1.eps}
  \caption{Contour plots of the \acs{eedf}s determined from \acs{pic}
    simulations, solutions of the two-term expansion, and corresponding

  \label{fig:picmb1}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics{./chapters/modeling/figures/picmb2.eps}
  \caption{Contour plots of the \acs{eedf}s determined from \acs{pic}

  \label{fig:picmb2}
\end{figure}
as a series of contour plots on a logarithmic scale. The jaggedness of the
\acs{pic} simulations results from the finite number of particles in the system
and the low probability of high energy electrons. This problem is ameliorated at
higher electric fields where the probability of high-energy electrons increases.
It is also helped by the ionization processes which begin to occur after the
first few nanoseconds.

At 10 Td, the \acs{eedf}s are relatively unchanged over the duration of the
simulation. The subtle slopes of the contours suggest a small increase in the
overall temperature and energy of the system as a function of time. This is more
noticeable at 30 Td, where the contours have a more distinct slope. The spacing
between the slopes is relatively constant for each case--equivalent to a
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. However, there is some deviation at low energies
in the case of the BOLSIG+ solutions.

At 60 and 100 Td, the \acs{pic} results begin to exhibit contour spacings which
are consistent at low energies, but begin to grow at higher energies. This is
evidence of a growing population of high-energy electrons, in excess of what is
predicted by a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Interestingly, the BOLSIG+
solutions exhibit unique contour shapes which are inconsistent with the other
cases. Additionally, the spacing of the contours is less consistent, with a
dearth of high energy electrons. 

By 300 and 600 Td this situation is reversed, as the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distributions exhibit a smaller population of high energy electrons when
compared to the \acs{pic} simulations. Examination of the individual
distributions shows that the \acs{pic} \acs{eedf}s have a larger population of
low energy (less than 20 eV) and high energy (greater than 100 eV) electrons.
This can be explained by the general shape of the cross sections. The only
reactions available to electrons in the \acs{pic} simulations are elastic
scattering, excitation (19.6 eV threshold), and ionization (24.6 eV threshold).
As the inelastic processes turn on at energies in excess of the 20 eV, the
electron population undergoes depletion. Likewise, the electron population
begins to rebound at higher energies as the cross sections fall off.

In the previous work by Starikovskaia and Starikovskii \cite{Starikovskaia2001a},
it was shown that strong electric fields in a nitrogen \acs{fiw} (600 Td) could
produce an \acs{eedf} with an elevated number of high-energy electrons relative
to the two-term approximation. However, it was also noted that the two-term
approximations showed reasonable agreement at weaker field strengths. This is
similar to results presented here for helium, there was no similar comparison to
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Notably, the Maxwell-Boltzmann and the
\acs{pic} simulations showed better agreement at electric fields of 100 Td
and below. Conversely, the BOLSIG+ and \acs{pic} results are more consistent at
the higher fields values, particularly for energies greater than 100 eV.

Of the three methods used to generate the \acs{eedf}s, only the \acs{pic}
simulations are strictly valid in the strong field limit. This suggests that the
\acs{pic} \acs{eedf}s are the most representative of the \acs{eedf}s found in
the \acs{rpnd}. While time-dependence of the \acs{pic} results prevents their
direct inclusion in the rate coefficient calculations, they can be used to judge
the relative merits of the BOLSIG+ solutions compared to the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distributions.

While the two-term expansion shows greater agreement in the high-energy tail,
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution was used in the global model. This assumption
was made as the improved agreement from the BOLSIG+ solutions only became
apparent at fields values of 300 Td or greater--near the upper limit of the
expected fields in the \acs{rpnd}. In contrast, the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distributions proved to provide better agreement at the lower electric fields
and mean electron energies.

\subsection{Energy Equation}

With an \acs{eedf}, the rate coefficients in equation~\ref{eq:gcont} can be
calculated. However, as was seen in figures~\ref{fig:picmb1}
and~\ref{fig:picmb2}, the distribution function changes over time. Previously,
the \acs{pic} simulations were used to determine the time evolution of the mean
electron energy, but an alternate approach was required for the global model.

Recall, from Chapter~\ref{chp:theory}, the energy equation,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{3}{2}p_\alpha\right) 
  + \nabla\cdot\frac{3}{2} (p_\alpha\vec{u}_\alpha)
  + p_\alpha\nabla\cdot\vec{u}_\alpha
  + \nabla\cdot\vec{q}_\alpha
  = \frac{\partial}{\partial
  t}\left(\frac{3}{2}p_\alpha\right)\bigg|_\mathrm{coll}.
\end{equation}
Given the assumptions underlying the global model, it can be modified to
calculate the evolution of the electron temperatures in the \acs{rpnd}. First,
per the assumption of a homogeneous system, the spatial derivatives can be
neglected,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{3}{2}p_e\right) =
  \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{3}{2}p_e\right)\bigg|_\mathrm{coll}.
\end{equation}
Subsequently, the ideal gas law can be used to relate the pressure of the
electrons to their energy density,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{3}{2}n_e\kB T_e \right) =
  \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{3}{2}n_e\kB T_e \right)\bigg|_\mathrm{coll}.
  \label{eq:energy2}
\end{equation}
The term on the RHS is the collision operator which expresses energy gained or
lost by electrons\footnote{In some plasmas, it is desirable to also treat gas
heating with a similar equation as it can have an appreciable impact on certain
rate constants. However, as noted in Chapter~\ref{chp:metastables}, the gas
temperature of the \acs{rpnd} in question remains at room temperature.} in
particle collisions.

Several different types of energy transfer were considered by the global model.
The first was the heating caused by the electric field. This was followed by
electron energy losses as a result of elastic scattering by the atoms. Finally,
inelastic collisions with all helium states through $n=4$ were considered.
Together, these phenomena replace the term on the RHS of
equation~\ref{eq:energy2} with,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{e^2n_eE(t)^2}{m_ek_m(T_e)N_g}
  - n_ek_m(T_e)N_g\left(\frac{3m_e}{M}\right)\frac{3}{2}\kB(T_e-T_g)
  - n_e \sum_i \sum_{j\neq i} K^e_{ij}N_i\Delta\epsilon_{ij},
  \label{eq:energyparts}
\end{equation}
where $E(t)$ is the time-varying electric field, $k_m$ is the electron momentum
transfer frequency from Pack et al. \cite{Pack1992}, and $\Delta\epsilon_{ij}$
is the energy lost or gained by the electron in atomic (de)excitation reactions.
The first term includes the DC conductivity \cite{Lieberman2005} of the plasma,
and accounts for the heating of the electrons by the electric field. The second
term is the elastic cooling of the electrons by the neutral atoms, where the gas
temperature. The third term is the energy gained or lost by the electrons in
atomic (de)excitation reactions. The
equations~\ref{eq:energyparts},~\ref{eq:energy2} and~\ref{eq:gcont} form the
primary components of the global model. Together they can be used to solve for
the evolution of the electron temperatures, electron densities, excited state
densities, and plasma emissions as functions of time.

\subsection{Model Solutions}

For the purposes of computation, equation~\ref{eq:gcont} can be rewritten for
each atomic state, $i$, resulting in a set of linear, first order differential
equations,
\begin{multline}
  \frac{d}{dt}

\end{multline}
where $M$ is the total number of atomic states and $\epsilon_i <
\epsilon_{i+1}$. An additional equation can be added to separately account for
electrons as and electron-specific processes, however the global model used here
assumed quasineutrality by enforcing the relation $N_\mathrm{ion}=n_e$. Changes
in the density of each atomic state were calculated by numerical integration of
these equations. A fourth order Runge-Kutta integration scheme with a time step
of 5 fs was used to solve the equations. Solutions with a time step of 2.5 fs
produced results with less than a 0.1\% difference from the 5 fs case. The full
code listing and a description of its methods is presented in
Appendix~\ref{chp:crammer}.

The initial metastable densities came from the \acs{las} measurements while the
initial electron densities were determined from \acs{lcif} measurements made by
Weatherford \cite{Weatherford2012a}. Electron density measurements were only
available for 1.0, 4.0, and 8.0 Torr; therefore, the global model analyses only
consider these conditions. Sensitivity to changes in the initial electron
density will be addressed in the following section.

It was necessary to assume a pre-pulse electron temperatures as no such
measurements were available. The 1 ms period between pulses is sufficiently long
such that the electrons lose much of their energy. Therefore the initial
electron temperature was expected to be significantly less than the 1-5 eV which
is characteristic of low temperature plasmas. As a starting point, an initial
temperature of 0.2 eV was assumed. Subsequent simulations varied this value
between 0.1 eV and 1.0 eV, but the resulting metastable densities changed by
less than 1\%. Following this observation, all simulations used 0.2 eV as the
initial electron temperature.

The relatively long period of time between pulses was assumed to be sufficient
for the excited states (excluding ions and metastables) to reach equilibrium
with the electron population. Therefore, the initial densities of excited states
were calculated from their values in equilibrium with the measured electron
densities at a temperature of 0.2 eV. The gas temperatures for all of the global
model simulations were fixed at 300 K.

Even though the waveform of the applied potential is known, the actual
time-evolution of the electric field at the metastable measurement points is not
well known. This is a result of the distinctly nonlinear impedance of the
\acs{rpnd} plasma. Takashima et al.\ performed measurements of the electric
field in a \acs{fiw} using a capacitive probe and found it to be significantly
different from the vacuum field. Separately, Ito et al. \cite{Ito2010} and
M\"{u}ller et al. \cite{Muller2011a}, measured the electric fields in a
\acs{rpnd} with a 1.2 mm gap between parallel electrodes using a wave-mixing
approach. They too found a large difference between the vacuum field and the
actual field.

In all three cases, the evolution of the electric field could be best described
by a Gaussian-like pulse, followed by a small, persistent electric field. This
persistent field was on the order of 20-25\% of the peak field value, and would
remain for at least several tens of nanoseconds. The total duration and
magnitude of the persistent field varied between studies, though some, such as
Anikin et al. \cite{Anikin1998}, did not find evidence of it. Given the
uncertainty associated with the nature of this persistent field, the global
model simulations only considered a single Gaussian pulse. The time domain of
the simulations covered 190 ns with the peak of the pulse centered at 40 ns.

\section{Perturbation Study}

It was difficult to predict the sensitivity of the metastable density
predictions produced by the global model to variations in the input parameters.
Given the lack of knowledge regarding the electric field, the sensitivity of the
results to changes in it were of particular interest. Therefore, three
simulations were run for four different input parameters: peak electric field,
pressure, pulse-width, and initial electron density. One simulation used a
nominal value, while the other two varied this value by $\pm10\%$. Each
parameter was varied independently in order to isolate its effects.

The nominal values for the simulation were determined by a preliminary fit of
the global model results to the measured metastable densities at 4.0 Torr. The
fit was accomplished by iterative changes to the electric field and the
pulse-width until the metastable density trend and magnitude matched the
measured results. The resulting nominal values are recorded in
table~\ref{tbl:nominal}.
\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{Nominal simulation parameters for the 4.0 Torr operating condition.}
  \begin{tabular}{llll}
    \toprule
    Pressure & Initial Electron    & Pulse      & Peak Electric \\
    (Torr)   & Density (m$^{-3}$)  & width (ns) & Field (Td)\\ 
    \midrule
    4.0      & 5.36$\times10^{13}$ & 40         & 207 \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tbl:nominal}
\end{table}

Figure~\ref{fig:perturbed}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/modeling/figures/perturbed.eps}
  \caption{Simulations showing the effects of perturbations to the initial
  conditions on the metastable dynamics.}
  \label{fig:perturbed}
\end{figure}
illustrates the metastable trends for each of the varied parameters. The dotted
line indicates the case where the nominal value has been increased by 10\%, and
the dashed line is used where the nominal value has been decreased by 10\%. The
metastable trends suggest that the initial electron density has a relatively
small impact on the metastable dynamics. Closer examination reveals that the
final metastable densities change by approximately $\pm10\%$, almost one-to-one
with the initial electron density. In contrast, changes to the pulse-width
produce much more significant changes in the metastable densities. As the
pulse-width is increased, the metastable densities increase. As the electric
field was fixed for these simulations, this change can be attributed to the
increase in energy deposited in the electron population.

The two most influential factors in the determination of the metastable
densities were the neutral gas pressure and the electric field. The
perturbations to these quantities resulted in largest changes in the final
metastable densities. As can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:perturbed}, increases in
pressure corresponded to a decrease in metastable densities. Changes to the
neutral gas pressure tend to affect the system via several different mechanisms.
As seen in equation~\ref{eq:energyparts}, increases to the gas pressure tend to
decrease the energy deposited in the electrons, and increases losses due to
elastic scattering. This reduces the energy that can be deposited in excited
states. However, the reduced electron energy density competes with the increased
number of ground state atoms available for excitation. The perturbation results
indicate that the reduced energy deposition in the electrons is more significant
than the increased availability of neutral atoms.

The large influence of the electric field can be traced back to changes in the
ionization rate for each condition. As seen in figure~\ref{fig:ionrates},
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/modeling/figures/ionrates.eps}
  \caption{Ionization rates coefficients from the ground state corresponding to
    the perturbed electric field simulations.}
  \label{fig:ionrates}
\end{figure}
the magnitude of the ionization rate coefficient corresponds to the magnitude of
the electric field. While the changes are somewhat modest, as seen in
Chapter~\ref{chp:theory}, ionization processes exponentially with time. This
means that small changes to the rate coefficient manifest as large differences
in the final electron density. Since the rate of metastable generation is
proportional to the electron density, large changes to the electron density
equate to large changes in the metastable density.

\section{Plasma Dynamics}

The plasma dynamics for the 1.0, 4.0, and 8.0 Torr conditions were obtained by
matching the simulated metastable densities to the measured metastable
densities. This was accomplished by iterative adjustments to the pulse-width and
the peak electric field. As mentioned earlier, despite the fact that the input
voltage pulse shape and amplitude are known, the plasma acts as a nonlinear
circuit component which can either broaden or shorten the pulse.

The matching process was complicated by the fact that multiple combinations of
the peak field and pulse-width could produce the same final metastable density.
Therefore, it was necessary to establish a method by which a unique combination
of the two values could be determined. Fortunately, each combination was found
to have slightly different shape in the metastable density trends.

This effect can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:widths}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/modeling/figures/widths.eps}
  \caption{Comparison of measured metastable values (open circles) to
    simulations (solid lines) for a range of pulse-widths.}
  \label{fig:widths}
\end{figure}
where 10 separate simulations were run with different combinations of peak
electric fields and pulse-widths. Each simulation produced the same final
metastable density, however the shorter pulse-widths (and higher electric
fields) corresponded to increasingly sharper increases in the metastable
density during the applied pulse. Despite this, the behavior of the metastable
density after the pulse is largely the same, regardless of the applied electric
field.

It is immediately apparent from figure~\ref{fig:widths} that the shorter
pulse-widths do not provide the best fit to the observed data. This conclusion
includes the results for the 25 ns pulsewidth, a result which was somewhat
unexpected as the width of the applied voltage pulse was no longer than 25 ns.
As previously mentioned, the photodiode used in the laser-absorption
measurements had a response time of 5 ns, well below the observed rise time of
the metastables.

The best fit to the measured results was obtained for a simulation with a
pulse-width of 40 ns. Though this value provided the best fit to the data, there
was no obvious physical mechanism associated with it. The long duration
suggested that additional or extended excitation may occur within the
\acs{rpnd}. A survey was made of the neutral emissions spectra in search of the
origin of this extended excitation. The specifics of these measurements will be
discussed in more detail in Chapter~\ref{chp:emissions}. The emissions for each
transition were expected to follow the same basic trend: an initial rise
correlating with the voltage pulse, followed by a monotonic decay. However,
several transitions exhibited trends that differed from this. The evolution of
the 4$^1$P$^\mathrm{o}$-2$^1$S transition at 396 nm was a good example of this
deviation and is reproduced in figure~\ref{fig:double}.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/modeling/figures/double.eps}
  \caption{The emissions of the 4$^1$P$^\mathrm{o}$-2$^1$S transition in the
  \acs{rpnd}, overlaid on top of the voltage pulse.}
  \label{fig:double}
\end{figure}
Here the emissions for each operating condition have been overlaid on the
applied voltage pulse for comparison. The voltage pulse clearly coincides with
an initial increase in the number of helium atoms occupying the
4$^1$P$^\mathrm{o}$ state. 15 ns later, another increase is visible,
particularly at 1.0 and 4.0 Torr. This second transient is similar to the return
strokes observed in streamer research \cite{Snoddy1936, Loeb1940, Mitchell1947}.
The observation of return strokes in similar studies \cite{Vasilyak1994,
Pai2009, Starikovskiy2013} suggests that this is a reasonable explanation for
the double-peaked emissions. If the forward and return strokes possess durations
equal to the applied voltage (25 ns), separated by 15 ns, then the excitation
period would be approximately 40 ns. This is consistent with the pulse-width
required to match the observed data. As a result, a pulse-width of 40 ns was
used in all subsequent simulations.

Figure~\ref{fig:fieldtau}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/modeling/figures/fieldtau.eps}
  \caption{The electric fields necessary to generate the same metastable density
    at 4.0 Torr as a function of the pulse-width.}
  \label{fig:fieldtau}
\end{figure}
is a scatter plot of the peak electric fields necessary to obtain the same final
metastable density as a function of the pulse-width. Initially, as the
pulse-width is decreased from 50 ns, only small increases of the electric field
are required to obtain the same number of metastable atoms. However, as the
pulse-width is decreased further, the rate at which the electric field must
increased grows substantially.

Eventually, for short enough pulses, it is no longer possible to maintain the
same metastable density, regardless of further increases in the electric field.
This occurs for the same reason that the \acs{eedf} from the \acs{pic}
simulations was depressed between 20 and 100 eV--eventually, the cross sections
fall off with increasing electron energy. This places an upper limit on the rate
coefficient as a function of electron temperature and a limit on the number of
metastables which can be generated for a given period of time.

Figure~\ref{fig:longrates}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/modeling/figures/longrates.eps}
  \caption{Ionization and metastable rate coefficients as functions of
    electron temperature.}
  \label{fig:longrates}
\end{figure}
shows the ionization and metastable rate coefficients as functions of electron
temperature. The ionization rate coefficient peaks at approximately 320 eV,
while the metastable rate coefficient peaks much lower at around 23 eV. The
disparity in the peaks is a result of the shape of the cross sections. The
ionization cross section peaks just past 100 eV while the peak metastable cross
section occurs at its threshold value, 19.8 eV. These rate coefficients suggest
that there is an optimal field strength for ionization and excited state
generation. Increases past this field strength would reduce the final density of
these particles. However, there may be additional benefits in the use of a
higher electric field. The runaway electrons which are generated at these field
strengths, as described by Vasilyak et al. \cite{Vasilyak1994}, Starikovskaia
and Starikovskii \cite{Starikovskaia2001a}, and others, can deposit their energy
far from the accelerating field. This could potentially result in an increased
discharge volume which would be advantageous in processing applications.

  \caption{Comparison of the measured metastable densities (open circles) to
    the global model simulations. The shaded region illustrates the measured
    voltage pulse. The parentheses following the 8.0 Torr labels indicate the
    axial location of the measurement: U - upstream, M - midstream, and D -
    downstream.}
  \label{fig:nmcomp}
\end{figure}
shows the comparison of the measured metastable densities for 1.0, 4.0, and 8.0
Torr overlaid atop the applied voltage pulse\footnote{The relative timing of the
metastable measurements and the voltage pulse are approximate. Corrections were
made in post-processing to account for different cable lengths in the system.}.
As seen in chapter~\ref{chp:metastables}, there was little axial variation in
the metastable measurements at 1.0 and 4.0 Torr. For this reason, simulations
were conducted only for the measurements at the midstream positions. In
contrast, the axial distribution of metastables showed noticeable variation at
8.0 Torr. Therefore, each location was considered independently in the
simulations.

Despite the assumptions involved in the development of the global model, the
simulation results show impressive agreement with the measurements. This
includes the period of 0-40 ns when the metastable growth rate is the largest.
The plasma behavior during this time is dominated by energetic electrons that
have been accelerated by the large electric fields. Given the relatively short
period, inter-atomic and radiative processes are relatively unimportant. However
the radiative processes are an important source of metastable atoms in the
post-pulse period as the electron population cools.

The most significant discrepancies appear in the 1.0 Torr simulations where the
global appears to overestimate the metastable density during the pulse, followed
by an underestimate after the pulse. While it is difficult to determine given
the noise in the measurements, this condition appears to require a pulse-width
\emph{wider} than the 40 ns used in the other simulations. More evidence of this
exceptionally broad excitation period is discussed in the following chapter.

Figure~\ref{fig:etemps}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/modeling/figures/etemps.eps}
  \caption{Global model predictions of the electron temperatures at the
  simulated conditions, overlaid on the corresponding electric field.}
  \label{fig:etemps}
\end{figure}
shows the evolution of the estimated electron temperatures in the system,
overlaid on the applied electric field. At 4.0 and 8.0 Torr, the electron
temperatures show a relatively modest growth and fall that correspond with the
electric field. The 4.0 Torr results peak at 16.3 eV and while each of the 8.0
Torr cases peak at above 11.4 eV. The cooling of the electrons through
approximately 30 ns is dominated by inelastic losses to atomic states. As the
electron temperatures fall so do the rate coefficients until most of the
electron-related excitation processes stop. At this point, the electron cooling
is dominated by elastic scattering.

Again, the results at 1.0 Torr are exceptional, in this case, for the
exceptionally large values. A temperature of 80 eV is unreasonably large in the
context of low temperature plasmas. This suggests that the assumptions used in
the global model may be failing at this condition. This is somewhat reinforced
by the electric fields were required to match the metastable measurements. As
can be observed in table~\ref{tbl:simsum}
\begin{table}

  \caption{Summary of the peak values for several plasma parameters from the
  global model simulations.}

  \label{tbl:simsum}
\end{table}
where the electric field approaches 350 Td for the 1.0 Torr discharge. As
observed earlier, this falls within the range of electric fields where the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution shows a marked difference from the \acs{pic}
predictions. As a result it is not clear that this electric field value or the
electron temperature measurements can be trusted for the 1.0 Torr case. 

To the extent that the results can be trusted, the table suggests that the
reduced electric field falls with increasing pressure. Though this would be
expected given the fixed amplitude of the applied voltage pulse, the change in
the reduced field is less than what would be expected from changes in neutral
density alone. 

Notably, the metastable densities and electron densities peak for different
conditions. The simulated electron density trends can be observed in
figure~\ref{fig:necomp}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/modeling/figures/necomp.eps}
  \caption{Global model predictions of the electrons densities at the simulated
  conditions overlaid on the reduced electric field.}
  \label{fig:necomp}
\end{figure}
overlaid on the reduced electric fields. The electron density peaks at the
lowest simulated pressure whereas the metastable density peaks at 4.0 Torr.
Again, this can be seen as a result of the rate coefficients for the respective
reactions. The ionization rate coefficient continues to increase well past 100
eV, whereas the metastable rate coefficient decreases after 23 eV. While the
increase in electron density competes with the decline in the metastable rate
coefficient, ultimately the rate coefficient falls too quickly. 

Also observable in the evolution of the electron densities is a time-delay
between the peak electric field and peak electron production rate for all
conditions. For the cases under consideration the peak ionization rate occurs at
about 23.5 ns at 1.0 Torr, 16.4 ns at 4.0 Torr, and 15.5 ns at 8.0 Torr. In
contrast, the electron temperatures in figure~\ref{fig:etemps} show little to no
such delay. In part, this behavior reflects the need for a finite amount of time
before the electron population reaches temperatures for which there is an
appreciable ionization rate. This is delay is compounded by the relatively low
seed electron densities and would likely be reduced with increased
pre-ionization.

Finally, the behavior axial behavior in the 8.0 Torr condition exhibits several
interesting characteristics. At the position closest to the anode, the peak
metastable density exceeds that of operation at 4.0 Torr. This contrasts with
the position furthest from the anode which features the lowest measured
metastable density for this range of conditions. However, the electric field and
electron temperatures across all three locations only vary by about one percent.
This recalls the electric field sensitivity that was noted in the earlier
perturbation study and suggests that even small variations in the electric field
of the \acs{rpnd} can have large implications on its homogeneity.

\section{Summary}

The metastable density measurements provide limited insight on the development
of the \acs{rpnd}. However, production of the metastable atoms is determined by
a number of other plasma quantities such as electron temperature, density, and
electric field strength. Following a series of assumptions, a global model
simulation was developed in order to infer the dynamics of these other
quantities. The development of the model made an attempt to evaluate the impact
of the choice of distribution function. This was followed by an investigation of
the model's sensitivity to changes in various system parameters.

A comparison of several preliminary simulations to measured metastable data
indicated the need for an electric field with a duration longer than applied
voltage pulse. Examination of the plasma emissions showed that the extended
excitation could be attributed to a return stroke in the system. Another
possible explanation includes the generation and slowing of an electron beam by
large electric fields. Use of this extended excitation time yielded excellent
agreement for all but the 1.0 Torr condition. In this case, what appeared to be
mild deviations appeared with the model overestimating metastable production
rate during the pulse, and underestimating it afterward. Given the large
electric fields in this condition, these discrepancies can most likely be
attributed to differences between the assumed \acs{eedf} and those in the actual
device.

It was found that breakdown of the \acs{rpnd} was accompanied by a finite delay
between the peak electric field value and the peak ionization rate. As the
generation of electrons is essentially exponential, this appeared to be the
result of the low pre-pulse electron densities and the finite heating time.
Interestingly, the peak electron and metastable densities did not coincide.
Instead, highest predicted electron density occurred at the same condition as
optimal energy coupling to the plasma, as seen in Chapter~\ref{chp:experiment}.
Simultaneously, as will be seen in Chapter~\ref{chp:emissions}, the peak
metastable density is associated with the peak brightness of the plasma, the
largest number of excited states, and the highest wave velocity. These
contrasting results demonstrate that the \acs{rpnd} can be optimized for one of
two conditions: production of excited atomic states, or ionization.
