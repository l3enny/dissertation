\section{Discharge Apparatus}

The design of the discharge apparatus was similar to the coaxial geometry used
by Vasilyak and others \cite{Vasilyak1994}. This configuration has the benefit
of minimizing the inductance of the system, which should aid in the propagation
of the pulse through the system. Figure~\ref{fig:appschem}

is a to-scale illustration of the discharge apparatus.

The main portion of the discharge was provided by a borosilicate glass tube with
Conflat flanges on either end. The glass portion of the tube had an inner
diameter of 3.3 cm, an outer diameter of 4.0 cm, and a length of 22.9 cm. The
total length of tube, including the glass tube, glass-to-metal transition, and
flanges was 30 cm. The flanges served as the electrodes for the plasma. Seen
here, the anode is located on the right, and the cathode/ground is located on
the left.

The cathode was connected to a second glass tube with the same dimensions as the
first. This tube led to the pumping apparatus and served to electrically isolate
it from the rest of the system. The cathode was also connected to ground through
a cylindrical ground shell which ran along the outside of the discharge tube.
The ground shell was held in place against the cathode with a copper shim and
Delrin shaft collar.

Two slots were milled into the ground shell on opposite sides. The slots were
3.8 cm by 30 cm and served to provide optical access to the discharge tube. The
side of the ground shell opposite the cathode terminated at a copper sheet, 10
cm square. The copper sheet was perpendicular to the axis of the discharge tube
and had a 5 cm hole for discharge tube to pass through. The ground shell was
connected to the copper sheet with conductive copper tape.

The copper sheet was secured to a Teflon tube, approximately 20 cm in length
with an inner diameter of about 7.5 cm and an outer diameter of 10 cm. The
Teflon tube provided electrical isolation for the anode from structures
supporting it. Surrounding the Teflon tube was a second ground shell composed of
copper. This was connected to the first ground shell by a braided copper strap.
The other end of the second ground shell ended in a similar square copper sheet,
10 cm on each side. This sheet was secured to the Teflon tube by nylon screws
and seated against the ground shell for electrical contact.

The copper sheet also featured a HN bulkhead adapter for connection to the
transmission line. The inner conductor of the bulkhead adapter was connected by
a straight run of 5 cm of silicone-coated wire to a Conflat window angled at
45$^\cdot$. The window was connected to a Conflat nipple, which in turn was
connected to a double-sided flange used as the gas inlet (access was provided by
a 2.54 cm diameter hole drilled into the surrounding Teflon tube). The other
side of the double-sided flange was connected to the anode of the discharge
tube.

The voltage pulse was provided by a \acs{fid} pulser, supplied by \textsc{anvs},
Inc. (model \smaller{PT510NM}). The amplitude of the pulse was fixed at 6.6 kV
with a repetition rate of 1.0 kHz. It is likely that the low conductivity of the
gas preceding each pulse resulted in a doubling of the pulse potential as it
reflected from the electrode. A \textsc{srs} \smaller{DG645} delay generator was
used as the master clock in all experiments and was used to trigger the pulser.
A 13.7 m transmission line was used in order to isolate reflections traveling
back and forth between the pulser and anode. The cable used was RG213, and HN
connectors were used to prevent breakdown between the center conductor and
ground.

The gas inlet connection was made through the double-sided flange via a 1/8"
\textsc{npt} hole. A 1/4" polyethylene tube was attached to the \textsc{npt}
connection via a \textsc{npt} to 1/4" Swagelok adapater. The tube was then
connected by Swagelok to a source of ultra-high purity (99.999\%) helium.
Throughout the experiment, the helium flow rate was fixed at 25.0 sccm,
regardless of the operating pressure.

The discharge apparatus was pumped down by a oil-based roughing pump with an
upstream zeolite trap. In each case, the system was evacuated by the roughing
pump to the base pressure, approximately 15 mTorr, via a large-diameter tube.
Based on this, the level of background impurities was estimated to be 80 ppm.
This pump path was the closed off, and additional pumping was performed via two
needle valve bypasses. The needle valves were used to adjust the pump rate in
order to obtain the desired system pressure, monitored by two capacitance
manometers with ranges of 10 and 100 Torr.

The assembled discharge apparatus can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:appphoto}.

The apparatus was supported on an optical breadboard 2.54 cm diameter posts and
angle brackets. Attached to one of the angle brackets was a small optical
breadboard with four bolts which served as physical references for aligning and
positioning the apparatus.

\section{Operating Procedure \& Conditions}

At the beginning of each day of operation, the system was initially pumped down
to base pressure. After this, the primary pump path was closed in favor of the
needle valve bypasses. The helium flow was then initiated at 25.0 sccm. Then,
the system pressure was adjusted to 3.0 Torr.

Once the pressure reached equilibrium, the pulser was turned on. The plasma was
allowed to run at this condition for one hour in order to remove built up
contamination on the walls and electrodes. During this time, the pressure of the
system would typically drift downwards by several percent. Afterward, the
pressure would be adjusted to the desired operating condition.

It was frequently necessary to turn off the pulser in between experiments. In
these cases, once the pulser was turned on, the plasma was allowed to run for 15
minutes before any measurements were made. This was necessitated by observable
changes in the emissions and current-voltage characteristics during the first 15
minutes of operation. Additional increases to this warm up time resulted in no
appreciable changes to any of the measured data.



\section{Initial Observations}

\acs{las}, emission, and coupling energy measurements were made at three
different operating pressures. The operating pressures were: 0.3, 0.5,
1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 8.0, and 16.0 Torr. Pressures below 10.0 Torr were
measured with a capacitance manometer with a full scale range of 10.0
Torr, above this a capacitance manometer with a full scale range of
100.0 Torr was used.

Optical measurements were made at three locations along the axis of the
discharge. The measurement location closest to the anode was separated
from it by a distance of approximately six inches. Each other optical
measurement location was moved further from the anode by an additional
three inches.

For each operating condition, measurements were made of the voltage and
current. The voltage measurement was made via an internal divider from
the power supply. Current measurements were made using an back-current
shunt located at a break in the outer shield of the transmission line.
The back-current shunt can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:bcs}. It is
composed of nine, low impedance, one ohm resistors, connected in
parallel. Each side of the resistors were soldered to a piece of copper
foil which was then soldered to the outer shield. A calibrated DC power
supply was used to measure the resistance of the current shunt.

All measurements were made using a LeCroy Waverider oscilloscope with a
bandwidth of 1 GHz. Connections were made using minimal lengths of RG
50/U cable. When necessary for timing purposes, the cable lengths were
matched.  Connections were made using minimal lengths of RG 50/U cable.
When necessary for timing purposes, the cable lengths were matched. All
measurements which required maximum bandwidth were made with a using
external 50 ohm terminators.

\section{Energy Coupling}
For comparison to other discharges, estimates of the energy coupling
were made using the current and voltage characteristics at each
operating pressure.

\section{Absorption Setup}
The \acs{las} setup was based upon the used of a distributed-feedback
laser diode. Temperature and current control of the diode provided
coarse and fine tuning, respectively, for the output frequency. It was
found that it was unnecessary to adjust the temperature for the diode
once the correct transition was found, therefore all tuning was
accomplished using current tuning.

The laser diode was produced by Toptica Photonics (model
\#LD-1083-0070-DFB-1), and had a nominal operating power of 70 mW at a
center wavelength of 1083 nm. The diode was held inside a Toptica DL-100
diode housing which contained an integral thermoelectric cooler and
collimating optics. The operation of the diode was controlled by a
Toptica DC 110 monitor, DCC 110 current control, DTC 110 temperature
control, and SC 110 scan control.

A schematic of the optical layout for the absorption experiment can be
seen in Figure \ref{fig:abslayout}. Immediately after exiting the
housing, the beam was passed through an optical isolator in order to
prevent instabilities from back reflections. Next the beam was
attenuated using a neutral density filter in order to keep its intensity
below the saturation level for the transition. Following that, the beam
passed through two apertures for alignment. Here, the beam was split by
a partially reflecting mirror. Approximately 98\% of the beam was
allowed to pass through to a reference photodiode (Thorlabs DET300).
After passing through the plasma, entered another aperture to limit
near-coincident plasma emissions. The background emissions were further
reduced using a long pass filter with a cutoff of 1000 nm. Finally, the
beam was coupled into an optical fiber which connected to the detection
electronics.

The transmitted laser light was detected with an InGaAs photodiode
(Thorlabs DET410). The signal from the diode was often too small to
detect, so the output of the signal photodiode was sent through a
voltage amplifier (Femto HVA-200M-40-B). The light response of this
system is limited by the photodiode which has a nominal rise time of
five nanoseconds. The signal from the amplifier was terminated by a 50
ohm terminator and sensed by the aforementioned oscilloscope.

\subsection{Acquisition Process} The actual acquisition process required
a specific series of steps in order to properly account for all noise
sources. In order to accommodate this process, a custom LabView script
was used to automate the acquisition of the laser transmission spectra.
Generally speaking, the signal can be described as
\begin{equation}
  V_\mathrm{total} = V_\mathrm{signal} + V_\mathrm{background} +
                     V_\mathrm{plasma}.
\end{equation}
In order to remove the background signal, the acquisition scr
