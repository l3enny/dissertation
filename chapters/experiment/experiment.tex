\section{Discharge Apparatus}

The design of the discharge apparatus was similar to the coaxial geometry used
by Vasilyak and others \cite{Vasilyak1994}. This configuration has the benefit
of minimizing the inductance of the system, which should aid in the propagation
of the pulse through the system. Figure~\ref{fig:appschem}
\begin{figure}

  \acs{rpnd} experiment.}

\end{figure}
is a to-scale illustration of the discharge apparatus.

The main portion of the discharge was provided by a borosilicate glass tube with
Conflat flanges on either end. The glass portion of the tube had an inner
diameter of 3.3 cm, an outer diameter of 4.0 cm, and a length of 22.9 cm. The
total length of tube, including the glass tube, glass-to-metal transition, and
flanges was 30 cm. The flanges served as the electrodes for the plasma. Seen
here, the anode is located on the right, and the cathode/ground is located on
the left.

The cathode was connected to a second glass tube with the same dimensions as the
first. This tube led to the pumping apparatus and served to electrically isolate
it from the rest of the system. The cathode was also connected to ground through
a cylindrical ground shell\footnote{While all of the outer conductors of the
system are nominally at ground, it is believed that they would float to finite
voltages with each pulse. This is a product of the nonideal impedance to ground
and the high frequencies associated with the fast pulse.} which ran along the
outside of the discharge tube. The ground shell was held in place against the
cathode with a copper shim and Delrin shaft collar.

Two slots were milled into the ground shell on opposite sides. The slots were
3.8 cm by 30 cm and served to provide optical access to the discharge tube. The
side of the ground shell opposite the cathode terminated at a copper sheet, 10
cm square. The copper sheet was perpendicular to the axis of the discharge tube
and had a 5 cm hole for discharge tube to pass through. The ground shell was
connected to the copper sheet with conductive copper tape.

The copper sheet was secured to a Teflon tube, approximately 20 cm in length
with an inner diameter of about 7.5 cm and an outer diameter of 10 cm. The
Teflon tube provided electrical isolation for the anode from structures
supporting it. Surrounding the Teflon tube was a second ground shell composed of
copper. This was connected to the first ground shell by a braided copper strap.
The other end of the second ground shell ended in a similar square copper sheet,
10 cm on each side. This sheet was secured to the Teflon tube by nylon screws
and seated against the ground shell for electrical contact.

The copper sheet also featured a HN bulkhead adapter for connection to the
transmission line. The inner conductor of the bulkhead adapter was connected by
a straight run of 5 cm of silicone-coated wire to a Conflat window angled at
45$^\cdot$. The window was connected to a Conflat nipple, which in turn was
connected to a double-sided flange used as the gas inlet (access was provided by
a 2.54 cm diameter hole drilled into the surrounding Teflon tube). The other
side of the double-sided flange was connected to the anode of the discharge
tube.

The voltage pulse was provided by a \acs{fid} pulser, supplied by \textsc{anvs},
Inc. (model \smaller{PT510NM}). The amplitude of the pulse was fixed at 6.4 kV
with a repetition rate of 1.0 kHz. Each pulse had a fixed width of 25 ns, with a
10\%-90\% rise time of approximately 4 ns and a roughly Gaussian shape. It is
likely that the low conductivity of the gas preceding each pulse resulted in a
doubling of the pulse potential as it reflected from the electrode. A
\textsc{srs} \smaller{DG645} delay generator was used as the master clock in all
experiments and was used to trigger the pulser. A 13.7 m transmission line was
used in order to isolate reflections traveling back and forth between the pulser
and anode. The cable used was RG213, and HN connectors were used to prevent
breakdown between the center conductor and ground.

The gas inlet connection was made through the double-sided flange via a 1/8"
\textsc{npt} hole. A 1/4" polyethylene tube was attached to the \textsc{npt}
connection via a \textsc{npt} to 1/4" Swagelok adapater. The tube was then
connected by Swagelok to a source of ultra-high purity (99.999\%) helium.
Throughout the experiment, the helium flow rate was fixed at 25.0 sccm with a
digital flow controller, regardless of the operating pressure.

The discharge apparatus was pumped down by a oil-based roughing pump with an
upstream zeolite trap. In each case, the system was evacuated by the roughing
pump to the base pressure, approximately 15 mTorr, via a large-diameter tube.
Based on this, the level of background impurities was estimated to be 80 ppm.
This pump path was the closed off, and additional pumping was performed via two
needle valve bypasses. The needle valves were used to adjust the pump rate in
order to obtain the desired system pressure, monitored by two capacitance
manometers with ranges of 10 and 100 Torr.

The assembled discharge apparatus can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:appphoto}.

  \label{fig:appphoto}
\end{figure}
The apparatus was supported on an optical breadboard 2.54 cm diameter posts and
angle brackets. Attached to one of the angle brackets was a small optical
breadboard with four bolts which served as physical references for aligning and
positioning the apparatus.

All electrical measurements were made with a LeCroy \smaller{6100A} WaveRunner
oscilloscope which had a bandwidth of 1.0 GHz. Electrical connections to the
oscilloscope were made with the shortest practical lengths of \smaller{RG 50/U}
coaxial cable and terminated at 50 $\Omega$ unless otherwise noted. The voltage
of the pulser was monitored from an internal $1:1000$ divider, and the current
was via a current shunt located in a break of the outer conductor of the
transmission line. The current shunt was composed of 9, low inductance, $1.0
\Omega$ resistors connected in parallel. Figure~\ref{fig:bcs}

  characteristics of the \acs{rpnd}.}
  \label{fig:bcs}
\end{figure}

Data were retrieved from the oscilloscope with a desktop computer via a
\textsc{gpib} connection. A LabView interface was used to interface with the
oscilloscope and additional instruments. Analog inputs and outputs (such as
laser control and pressure sensing) were handled by a \textsc{srs}
\smaller{sr850 dsp} lock-in amplifier which performed as an \emph{ad hoc} data
acquisition system.

\section{Operating Procedure \& Conditions}

At the beginning of each day of operation, the system was first pumped down to
base pressure. After this, the primary pump path was closed in favor of the
needle valve bypasses. The helium flow was then initiated at 25.0 sccm. Then,
the system pressure was adjusted to 3.0 Torr.

Once the pressure reached equilibrium, the pulser was turned on. The plasma was
allowed to run at this condition for one hour in order to remove built up
contamination on the walls and electrodes. During this time, the pressure of the
system would typically drift downwards by several percent. Afterward, the
pressure would be adjusted to the desired operating condition.

It was frequently necessary to turn off the pulser in between experiments. In
these cases, once the pulser was turned on, the plasma was allowed to run for 15
minutes before any measurements were made. This was necessitated by observable
changes in the emissions and current-voltage characteristics during the first 15
minutes of operation. Additional increases to this warm up time resulted in no
appreciable changes to any of the measured data.

Measurements were made for a range of pressures, including: 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0
3.0, 4.0, 8.0, and 16.0 Torr. The lower limit was set by the pumping speed of
the roughing pump. Difficulty in obtaining reliable plasma breakdown at
pressures above 16.0 Torr set an upper limit on the pressure range. Experimental
measurements of optical properties were obtained at three axial locations: 3.83,
11.45, and 19.07 cm relative to the boundary between the anode and the glass
tube.

\section{Initial Observations}

Plasma characteristics could be divided into approximately three cases: low,
intermediate, and high pressure. At the low pressures, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 Torr,
it was difficult to initiate a discharge. Frequently, the plasma would have to
be started at more moderate pressures, and then adjusted to the desired
condition. At these conditions, the plasma was dim compared to the ambient room
light and a dull purple. It appeared to be well separated from the walls.
Visually, the diameter of the plasma was estimated to be about 2 cm, however
this increased with pressure. Also occurring at these conditions was a large
amount of electronic noise. Nearby instruments, such as the computer mouse, and
lock-in amplifier, would occasionally malfunction at these conditions.

At moderate pressures, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 Torr, the plasma expanded radially to
fill the whole of the discharge volume. Compared to ambient conditions the
plasma was bright with an orange-pink hue. Electrical interference disappeared
at these conditions, and the plasma initiation was relatively easy.
Nevertheless, at the beginning of each day several thousand pulses could be
required before a visible plasma was formed. Interestingly, the plasma extended
well past the cathode/ground and to the pumping section (connected to ground at
a separate point). Presumably, this is a result of the relatively small cathode
area compared to the large anode area. The build up of space charge limits the
current extraction from the intended cathode, subsequently the electrode further
downstream begins to contribute.

For the higher operating pressures, 8.0 and 16.0 Torr, the brightness of the
plasma decreased, though not to the level of the low pressure discharge. In
addition, the plasma remained volume-filling. However, it did not visibly
extended past the cathode. Discharge initiation was difficult at these operating
conditions and, as in the low pressure case, the plasma would have to be started
at more amenable conditions. No electrical interference was noted for this
pressure range.

Cursory examination of the voltage signal revealed a large number of reflections
in the system. These can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:waveform},
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/experiment/figures/waveform.eps}
  \caption{Typical voltage waveform of the \acs{rpnd}. Arrows indicate
  reflections back to the pulser. The pulser exhibited a double pulsing
  phenomena, indicated by the dotted line.}
\end{figure}
a typical voltage waveform with overlaid arrows indicating the reflected pulses.
These can be attributed to the impedance discontinuity at the electrode. Also
observable in the waveform is a second pulse and its associated reflection. This
is believed to be a peculiarity of the particular power supply used. The
majority of the presented results, particularly those concerning the fast
dynamics will only consider the initial pulse.

\section{Field Calculations}

The electric field characteristics of the discharge system was analyzed using a
two-dimensional, electrostatic solver, Ansoft Maxwell 9. Figure~\ref{fig:fields}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/experiment/figures/fields.jpg}
  \caption{Heat map and vector plot of the electric field in the \acs{rpnd}
  discharge apparatus.}
  \label{fig:fields}
\end{figure}
is a heat map on a logarithmic scale, of the electric field magnitude, with
overlaid electric field vectors (in magenta). The electric field varies
significantly over the length of the discharge apparatus, with a peak near the
axial location of the glass tube followed by a monotonic decline. These
characteristics are a large departure from simple case of two parallel
electrodes in which the field is uniform throughout. This can be attributed to
the presence of the external ground shield. Though this does complicate the
field characteristics, the proximity of the ground results in a much higher
electric field than would otherwise be achievable.

While the off-axis field lines all feature notable radial components,
particularly close to the anode the center line does not.
Figure~\ref{fig:centere}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/experiment/figures/centere.eps}
  \caption{The magnitude of the electric field along the center and outside of
  the discharge apparatus.}
  \label{fig:centere}
\end{figure}
is a plot of the magnitude of the electric field along the central axis of the
discharge apparatus and the outside, adjacent to the glass tube. The location of
the anode is defined as the location of the glass-to-metal seal. The field close
to the triple point at the seal is the highest at approximately 3.5 kV/cm, while
the field along the axis peaks at about 1.5 kV/cm. At a distance of 2 cm from
the anode, the electric field magnitude is roughly the same regardless of the
radial coordinate. At the measurement locations of 3.83, 11.45, and 19.07 cm,
the vacuum electric field was $4.8 \times 10^5$, 750, and 11 V/m respectively. 

\section{Energy Coupling}

The energy coupling to the plasma for the first pulse (not including
reflections) was calculated by integration of the current and voltage product.
Figure~\ref{fig:energy}
\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics{./chapters/experiment/figures/energy.eps}

\end{figure}
shows a closer view of the incident and reflected voltage and current pulse.

\section{Wave Velocity}

\section{Absorption Setup}
The \acs{las} setup was based upon the used of a distributed-feedback
laser diode. Temperature and current control of the diode provided
coarse and fine tuning, respectively, for the output frequency. It was
found that it was unnecessary to adjust the temperature for the diode
once the correct transition was found, therefore all tuning was
accomplished using current tuning.

The laser diode was produced by Toptica Photonics (model
\#LD-1083-0070-DFB-1), and had a nominal operating power of 70 mW at a
center wavelength of 1083 nm. The diode was held inside a Toptica DL-100
diode housing which contained an integral thermoelectric cooler and
collimating optics. The operation of the diode was controlled by a
Toptica DC 110 monitor, DCC 110 current control, DTC 110 temperature
control, and SC 110 scan control.

A schematic of the optical layout for the absorption experiment can be
seen in Figure \ref{fig:abslayout}. Immediately after exiting the
housing, the beam was passed through an optical isolator in order to
prevent instabilities from back reflections. Next the beam was
attenuated using a neutral density filter in order to keep its intensity
below the saturation level for the transition. Following that, the beam
passed through two apertures for alignment. Here, the beam was split by
a partially reflecting mirror. Approximately 98\% of the beam was
allowed to pass through to a reference photodiode (Thorlabs DET300).
After passing through the plasma, entered another aperture to limit
near-coincident plasma emissions. The background emissions were further
reduced using a long pass filter with a cutoff of 1000 nm. Finally, the
beam was coupled into an optical fiber which connected to the detection
electronics.

The transmitted laser light was detected with an InGaAs photodiode
(Thorlabs DET410). The signal from the diode was often too small to
detect, so the output of the signal photodiode was sent through a
voltage amplifier (Femto HVA-200M-40-B). The light response of this
system is limited by the photodiode which has a nominal rise time of
five nanoseconds. The signal from the amplifier was terminated by a 50
ohm terminator and sensed by the aforementioned oscilloscope.

\subsection{Acquisition Process} The actual acquisition process required
a specific series of steps in order to properly account for all noise
sources. In order to accommodate this process, a custom LabView script
was used to automate the acquisition of the laser transmission spectra.
Generally speaking, the signal can be described as
\begin{equation}
  V_\mathrm{total} = V_\mathrm{signal} + V_\mathrm{background} +
                     V_\mathrm{plasma}.
\end{equation}
In order to remove the background signal, the acquisition scr
