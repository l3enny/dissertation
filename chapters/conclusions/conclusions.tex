The repetitively-pulsed nanosecond discharge \acs{rpnd} is a low temperature
plasma with several properties which make it amenable to novel applications.
Some of these properties include its production of a large uniform discharge (on
the order of liters), negligible gas heating, and operation over a wide range of
pressures (from $10^{-3}$--$1$ atmospheres) \cite{Starikovskaia2001}. Though the
\acs{rpnd} has only recently been enabled by recent advances in semiconductor
technology, it shares a long history with other pulsed discharges. This group of
discharges includes the fast ionization wave (\acs{fiw}), streamers, sparks, and
lightning \cite{Loeb1965}.

Despite long history associated with pulsed discharges, in-depth study of these
phenomena has been challenging. A review of the literature found that the
important dynamics of the \acs{rpnd}, which can occur in a matter of
nanoseconds, were not well-explored. Time-scales this short present a number of
technical difficulties for plasma measurements. Separately, the high electric
fields and the substantial collisionality within the \acs{rpnd} precludes the
use of many traditional plasma diagnostic techniques. Thus, most studies have
focused on measurements of the plasma properties after the pulse or averaged
over the pulse.

However, as with most plasmas, the properties of the \acs{rpnd} are determined
by the coupling between the applied electric field and the gas. As this coupling
is a result of fundamental processes which occur during the nanosecond pulse,
such as electron acceleration and collisional excitation, the \acs{rpnd} can not
be understood without more detailed consideration of the dynamics which occur
during its initial phases.

\section{Overview of Results}

The over-arching goal of the study, then, was to elucidate the flow of energy
from the electric field, through the electrons, to the gas, during the formation
of the \acs{rpnd}. The investigation of the energy flow was subdivided into
several complementary measurements and simulations. The energy input was
characterized through current-voltage characteristics and energy coupling
measurements. This was then followed by measurements of the excited atomic state
dynamics with passive and active spectroscopic techniques. Finally, the results
were compared to estimates produced by a global model of the \acs{rpnd}.

The process of accomplishing these goals, began with the development of the
theories necessary to describe the \acs{rpnd}. Specifically, the Boltzmann
equation and Maxwell's equations, were used as the starting point of the
theoretical analysis. Several reductions of the Boltzmann equation were
presented in the form of moments. These moments averaged over the velocity space
of the probability distribution in order to simplify the solution of the
equations.

Following the discussion of the statistical descriptions applied to plasmas, the
criteria for a plasma were presented. A plasma is distinct from an ionized gas
in the sense that its behavior is dominated by its electromagnetic properties.
Thereafter, the initiation of a plasma from one or a few seed electrons was
explained for the two primary cases. The first, the Townsend mechanism, occurs
for relatively small electric fields, long periods of time, and does not involve
the formation of appreciable space charge. In contrast, the streamer mechanism,
involves a high electric field, develops over a shorter period of time, and is
influenced by the formation of large regions of space charge.

It is the properties of the streamer mechanism which bear the most resemblance
to the \acs{rpnd}. However, the streamer model does not automatically account
for the uniform nature of the \acs{rpnd}. Instead, this uniformity was described
by the work of Levatter and Line \cite{Levatter1980}. They demonstrated that a
streamer can develop in a uniform manner provided a sufficient density of
pre-pulse electrons. Calculations for the subsequent experimental conditions
found that the natural background electron density was sufficient to guarantee
uniform breakdown at all operating pressures.

As the plasma measurements were focused on spectroscopic quantities, an
explanation of atomic structure and notation was then provided. Afterward,
several factors affecting the spectral lineshape of atomic transitions were
discussed. The theory concluded with a brief description of stimulated
absorption by atoms, the cross section for interaction, and the concept of
saturation.

Subsequently, an experimental \acs{rpnd} was described. It was generated by
repetitive positive voltage pulses in ultra-high purity helium at several
different pressures. The discharge geometry was of a coaxial design similar to
the \acs{fiw} studies reviewed by Vasilyak et al. \cite{Vasilyak1994}. Visual
observations and the ease with which breakdown was obtained suggested that the
plasma was most stable at a pressure of 4.0 Torr. However, estimates of the
energy coupling from the current-voltage measurements indicated that greatest
energy coupling occurred at 1.0 Torr, with a peak value of 5.5 mJ. This was
consistent with previous experimental measurements of the energy coupling in
\acs{rpnd}s and \acs{fiw}s.

Laser-absorption spectroscopy (\acs{las}) of the 2$^3$S, or triplet metastable,
state of helium was the primary means by which the nanosecond discharge dynamics
were measured. This technique produced measurements of the temperature and
line-integrated density of the triplet metastable state over the duration of the
pulse. The triplet metastable level was investigated because it can act as a
large energy reservoir in helium discharges and can increase the charged
particle population via associative ionization and Penning ionization. The use
of an active optical diagnostic, meant that the time resolution of the
measurements were only limited by the bandwidth of the detector, 5 ns.

The results of the \acs{las} confirmed that no gas heating was occurring in the
\acs{rpnd}. The accuracy of the temperature measurements varied with respect to
the metastable density, but was generally about $\pm50$ K. The largest detected
line-integrated densities, prior to the reflected pulse, occurred for the 4.0
Torr condition at a value of about 5.9$\times10^{16}$ m$^{-2}$. Assuming a
uniform density distribution across the discharge tube, this is equivalent to a
density of 1.8$\times10^{17}$ m$^{-3}$. A significant number of metastable atoms
persisted between pulses for pressures of 1.0 Torr and lower.

There were no observable trends in the metastable densities with respect to
axial location for pressures of 4.0 Torr and lower. This provides additional
confirmation of the homogeneous and volume-filling nature of the \acs{rpnd}. In
contrast, results at 8.0 and 16.0 Torr showed a clear decline in metastables
densities as a function of distance from the anode. This is believed to be akin
to the wave attenuation in \acs{fiw}s, described by Vasilyak et al.
\cite{Vasilyak1994}.

Long duration measurements of the metastable densities revealed the primary
decay processes in this discharge geometry. Metastable destruction at low
pressures was dominated by associative ionization; indicated by deviations from
a purely exponential decay. As the pressure of the system was increased, the
three-body reaction (leading to the formation of helium dimers) became the
dominant destruction process. Decay constants significantly larger than
those reported by Deloche et al. \cite{Deloche1976} and Phelps and Molnar
\cite{Phelps1953} suggest that gaseous impurities played a significant role in
metastable destruction.

A global model was then developed in order to infer various other plasma
parameters from the metastable measurements. The development of the model
included an analysis of the likely electron energy distribution functions
(\acs{eedf}s) in the \acs{rpnd} with a series of zero-dimensional
particle-in-cell (\acs{pic}) simulations. For fields of 100 Td and less, the
\acs{pic} simulations showed good agreement with Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions
of the same mean electron energy. However, above 300 Td, the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distributions exhibited significantly fewer high-energy (greater than 100 eV)
electrons.

It was speculated that this disagreement stemmed from the behavior of the
interaction cross sections. In general, these cross sections peak at several
times the threshold value, after which they rapidly decline. At the high
electric fields, the electrons can reach the energies associated with these
reduced electric fields, resulting in a higher-than-expected population of
high-energy electrons. Better agreement with the \acs{pic} simulations at these
field strengths were obtained with solutions of the two-term expansion of the
Boltzmann equation which can account for the cross section variation with
energy. However, as a result of significant disagreements at lower electric
fields, the global model assumed a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the
entirety of the simulations.

The global model simulations which best matched the measured metastable density
trends required the use of an exceptionally long electric field, 40 ns in
length, compared to the 25 ns length of the applied pulse. Upon inspection of
the optical emissions from the plasma, a return stroke was identified that
appeared to explain this longer-than-expected excitation. Based on previous
results in \acs{fiw} research \cite{Starikovskaia1998}, an alternative
explanation was also proposed in which a beam-like electron population formed in
the \acs{rpnd} and its relaxation was responsible for the extended excitation.

Using the long excitation period with the global model produced an excellent
match to the measured metastable densities, both during the pulse and afterward.
Particularly good agreement was obtained at 4.0 and 8.0 Torr conditions. Small
deviations were observed at 1.0 Torr--the metastable density appeared to rise
too quickly during the pulse, and too slowly after the pulse. These
discrepancies provided a second hint that energetic electrons may be present in
the system, specifically at the lower pressure conditions.

The potential for energetic electrons was reinforced by the magnitude of the
electric fields and inferred electron temperatures necessary to match the
metastable densities. At 1.0 Torr, the peak electric field was 346 Td and the
peak electron temperature was estimated at 74.6 eV. This suggests that the
global model is likely inaccurate for this condition given the disagreement
between the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and the \acs{pic} simulations at
field values over 300 Td. Additionally, the electron temperature is far in
excess of what can be considered reasonable for an equilibrium population of
electrons in a low temperature plasma.

In contrast, the global model predictions at 4.0 and 8.0 Torr were better
aligned with previously reported values. The electron temperatures are similar
to those recently obtained for a \acs{fiw} \cite{Takashima2011}, as well as
those predicted from rate coefficient calculations \cite{Aleksandrov2007}.
Likewise, the electric fields are more reasonable than those predicted at 1.0
Torr, though they fall in the intermediate region between 100 and 300 Td.

Interesting to note was a delay between the peak electric field and the highest
ionization rate in the plasma. The delay between the two was interpreted as the
time required for the seed electron population to reach ionization-relevant
temperatures. In a simplified system, the ionization rate is an exponential
function of time, thus the density grows quickly thereafter.

Emission measurements of ten separate transitions in the visible wavelengths
were used to measure the wave velocities of the \acs{rpnd}. While the rate of
rise of the emissions depended on the transition, the wave velocity estimates
remained largely the same. In the \acs{rpnd} the measured velocities were:
1.7-3.0$\times10^7$ m/s at 8.0 Torr, and 0.7-1.5$\times10^7$ at 16.0 Torr. All
other conditions had wave velocities that were greater than 5$\times10^7$ m/s.

The global model was designed to consider a total of 20 different species and
535 different reaction processes, including optical transitions. The inclusion
of all the allowed transitions between excited states made it possible to
evaluate of several potential optical diagnostics for electron temperature and
an opportunity for comparison with results from the measured emissions.

The first attempt to determine the evolution of the electron temperature used
Boltzmann plots generated for each time point. The Boltzmann plots from the
simulated emissions and measured emissions both resulted in temperature
estimates of about 0.5-0.6 eV. However, the temperatures estimated from the
simulated emissions were not consistent with the temperatures produced by the
global mode simulations. This inconsistency indicated that there was likely a
fundamental flaw in the assumptions used to determine electron temperatures from
Boltzmann plots.

The reason for this lies in the assumption of partial local thermodynamic
equilibrium in the plasma. This requires that the excited state populations used
in the Boltzmann plot are in equilibrium with the electrons \cite{Kunze2009}.
However, the \acs{rpnd} likely develops too rapidly for this equilibrium to take
place. This conclusion was reinforced by an examination of the individual
Boltzmann plots for a series of times after the pulse.

Subsequently, an attempt was made to determine the electron temperature via a
coronal model and the use of line ratios \cite{Griem2005}. As with the global
model, this approach requires the assumption of an \acs{eedf}. Subsequently, the
accuracy of the results will depend on how closely the \acs{eedf} in a
\acs{rpnd} adheres to the assumed one.

For consistency with the global model, a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution was
used. The use of this assumption likely produced estimates of the electron
temperature that were not accurate with respect to their absolute magnitude.
However, as long as the shape of the \acs{eedf}s are consistent for the duration
of the measurement period, the results will be proportional to the some mean
energy. This allows an evaluation and comparison of the relative temperatures in
the \acs{rpnd}.

Overall, three line ratios were considered however one was immediately rejected
for lack of detectable emissions. The second, which compared the
4$^3$S-2$^3$P$\odd$ transition to the 4$^1$D-2$^1$P$\odd$ transition was used
with little success. The estimates based on the measured emissions produced
unrealistic temperatures. Additionally, the estimates from the simulated
emissions were not consistent with the actual temperatures from the global
model, suggesting that this particular ratio was not suitable for temperature
estimates.

The second line ratio which compared the 3$^3$S-2$^3$P$\odd$ transition to the
3$^1$S-2$^1$P$\odd$ transition produced more promising results. The estimates
from the simulated emissions were consistent with the global model temperatures,
which demonstrated that the line could potentially work provided the global
model results are applicable. However, the estimates from the measured emissions
were less successful. For most points in time, the two transitions were too dim
to obtain a reliable ratio. It was possible to obtain an estimate of the
electron temperature at 4.0 Torr. The results of the line ratio indicated a peak
electron temperature of about 5 eV, followed by a quick cooling to 0.5 eV. As
the coronal model relies on the assumption of a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution,
the use of such a distribution will almost certainly produce misleading and
incorrect results at pressures of 1.0 Torr and below.

Additional comparisons were made between the simulated and measured emissions
for the 3$^1$D-2$^1$P$\odd$ transition, at 1.0, 4.0, and 8.0 Torr. Some general
features, such as the timing of the peak intensity, and the relative intensities
between pressures were consistent between the two. However the simulated
emissions generally decayed away faster after the peak intensity as compared to
the measured emissions. This suggested a prolonged excitation period in the
\acs{rpnd}, again hinting at the presence energetic electrons.

Furthermore, the decay rate of the measured emissions had a noticeable pressure
dependence. This suggested an atomic process was responsible, one which was not
accounted for in the global model. The metastable measurements suggested that
Penning ionization of impurities was an important loss mechanism. As a result,
it is believed likely that the 3$^1$D state was also affected by collisions with
gaseous impurities. This would explain the pressure dependence observed in the
measured emissions.

In summary, this work identified several key characteristics of the \acs{rpnd}
based on spectroscopic measurements and modeling. Several processes affecting
the charged particle population and energy residence time in the \acs{rpnd} were
identified. In addition, several anomalies were noted at the analysis of the
data at 1.0 Torr and below, indicating a high degree of non-equilibrium and the
potential presence of beam-like electrons. Finally several approaches to the
measurement of electron temperature trends were evaluated for their application
to similar experiments.

\section{Future Work}

There are several opportunities to improve on the work presented here. From an
experimental perspective, the metastable density measurements could be improved
by the use of a more sensitive detector. This would decrease the minimum
detectable metastable density and potentially provide pre-pulse metastable
densities for the other operating pressures. It would also be desirable to
revisit the existing metastable density measurements along various chords of the
discharge cylinder. This would provide radial density profiles via inversion
techniques.

The emission measurements could also stand to be improved by the use of a more
efficient grating, a more efficient photocathode, or both. These changes should
be made with measurement of the 706 and 728 nm lines in mind, as these appear to
be the most promising for transitions for use in optical electron temperature
measurements. Further improvements to the optical temperature measurements could
be made with the development of an appropriate collisional radiative model and
perhaps the use of alternative \acs{eedf}s in the calculation of the rate
coefficients.

The experiment could also be improved with the relatively simple addition of a
capacitive probe for sensing of the electric field within the plasma, similar to
that used by Takashima et al. \cite{Takashima2011}. The electric field
measurements would allow for confirmation of the return stroke which was
observed in the emissions data. The probe may also be used to determine if a
persistent electric field exists after the pulse.

The electric field information could then be incorporated into the global model
for more accurate predictions of the \acs{rpnd} properties. Other improvements
to the global model would include the addition of gas impurities and reactions
in response to the evidence that they contribute to the \acs{rpnd} dynamics.

However, the global model is still fundamentally limited in how it handles the
\acs{eedf} within the \acs{rpnd}. This may be improved, to some extent, by the
inclusion of a Boltzmann solver. That said, the investigation of the \acs{eedf}s
suggests that the two-term expansion may not be sufficient for the fields in the
\acs{rpnd}. Another possibility is the use of a Boltzmann-like distribution
where $f(\epsilon)\propto \exp (\epsilon^\alpha / \kB T_e)$, where $\alpha$ is
can be varied to obtain a distribution with a suitable high-energy tail.

Alternatively, a zero-dimensional \acs{pic} model could be used, similar to the
one which was employed in the \acs{eedf} calculations. It should be possible
develop such a code with the inclusion of the improved cross sections of
Ralchenko et al. \cite{Ralchenko2008} as well as the optical transitions from
Kramida \cite{Kramida2012}. This approach would neatly sidestep the \acs{eedf}
issues, however there is the concern that this may lead to an excessively
demanding computational problem. Some simplification could be accomplished using
a hybrid method or by only using \acs{pic} calculations above certain field
values.

\section{Final Remarks}

The experimental and simulation results presented represent one of the few
comprehensive attempts to analyze the nanosecond timescale dynamics of a
\acs{rpnd}. Several mechanisms, including the dynamics of the metastable
population, have been identified which may influence the evolution and stability
of a helium \acs{rpnd}. In addition, evidence has been provided for beam-like
electrons at low operating pressures, and the effects of impurities on the
lifetimes of excited states.

Each of these phenomena represent an important component of how the nanosecond
pulse couples energy into a gas. In turn, it is the energy in that gas--the
electrons, ions, excited states, internal fields, and photons, which lends the
\acs{rpnd} its ability to purify water \cite{Malik2001}, sterilize surfaces
\cite{Ayan2009}, alter air flow \cite{Nishihara2007}, and generate nanoparticles
\cite{Ostrikov2011}. It is only through an improved understanding of how this
energy is distributed in a plasma that applications, such as these, can be
realized.
