The global model was used to infer the electric field, electron densities, and
electron temperatures in the \acs{rpnd} from the metastable measurements.
However, as was described in the development of the model, it is also capable of
predicting the densities of other excited states and the optical emissions of
the \acs{rpnd}. This chapter describes the measurement of the optical emissions
of the \acs{rpnd} and their analysis in the determination of wave velocities,
electron temperatures, and the identification of other phenomena pertinent to
the development of the \acs{rpnd}.

\section{Emission Measurements}

The emissions of the \acs{rpnd} were studied over the same operating conditions
as the metastable measurements--for pressures from 0.3-16.0 Torr, and at three
axial locations. The light from the system was collected by a optical fiber
bundle, 1 cm in diameter. The bundle was positioned several millimeters from the
glass envelope and no additional collection optics were used.

The other side of the bundle was aligned with the entrance slit of an ISA
Jobin-Yvon SPEX HR460 monochromator. The monochromator had a focal length of 460
mm, and was fitted with a grating with 1200 grooves/mm. The entrance slit was
set to 250 $\mu$m, and the exit slit was set to 500 $\mu$m. The specified
dispersion of the monochromator was 1.76 nm/mm, therefore the approximate
bandpass of the monochromator was 0.88 nm. This was sufficiently large to
collect the integrated emissions of a single transition, given proper
positioning of the grating.

The detector was a photomultiplier tube (\acs{pmt}) of model C31034, but of
unknown make. The tube voltage was set to 1900 V and was terminated into a 50
$\Omega$ resistor. Specifications could not be found for the tube, however
measurements demonstrated a rise time of, at most, 3.5 ns. The emissions of each
line were measured from approximately 1 $\mu$s prior to the pulse, to 4$\mu$s
after the pulse. The sampling rate was 1 GHz, and each emission curved was
average over 1000 separate pulses.

The range of spectral sensitivity for the photocathode of the \acs{pmt} limited
measurements to transitions occurring between 350-750 nm.
Table~\ref{tbl:transitions} lists the transitions which were recorded.

The optical response of the system varied with respect to wavelength. This was a
result of several factors, including the fiber, the grating, photocathode
coating, and more. An irradiance standard was used to correct for the varying
spectral sensitivity of the system. The standard was an Optronic Laboratories
M-1179 tungsten lamp, powered by an Optronic Laboratories OL 65 power supply.
The fiber was repositioned to collect light from the lamp and the \acs{pmt}
signal was measured at each of the emission wavelengths listed in
table~\ref{tbl:transitions}. The measured signals were then combined with the
tabulated spectrum of the lamp to generate correction factors at each transition
wavelength.

\section{Wave Velocities}

The breakdown of \acs{rpnd}s and \acs{fiw} is often described in terms of waves.
This recalls the terminology used by Loeb \cite{Loeb1965} to describe the
fundamental mechanisms involved. While the wave in question is one of the
potential gradient in the system, optical measurements have often been used to
measure its velocity. This assumes the timing of the optical emissions reliably
correlate to the potential gradient.

Though this assumption is not strictly true (a changing electric field need not
be accompanied by any emissions whatsoever), optical measurements of the wave
velocity are one of the most common and easily accomplished diagnostics for these
types of discharges \cite{Vasilyak1994}. As a result, it provides some basis for
comparison, even if the wave ``velocity'' is a complex function of pressure,
pre-ionization, gas, geometry, dielectric, and more. In this case, the relative
difference in the timing of the optical emissions from the different axial
locations were used to estimate the wave velocity.

The maximum detectable velocity was 5.0$\times10^7$ m/s, and was primarily
determined by the jitter in the timing of the pulser output. Additional
uncertainty was introduced in the determination relative delay in emissions
between the various axial locations. In order to minimize the uncertainty in the
delay values, the timing was determined by the largest positive derivative of
each emissions curve. However, even minor noise in the \acs{pmt} signals made
this approach unreliable. Subsequently, a smoothing spline was used to minimize
the uncertainty introduced by the noise.

Wave velocities were calculated independently for each transition. This was
necessary as some transitions exhibited much slower rise times than others. The
upper states of these transitions are most likely populated by the decay of
higher excited states (radiative cascade), rather than the energetic electrons
associated with the wave. Despite this, the velocity estimates did not appear to
possess any meaningful dependence on the transition used. As a result, the
velocity estimates were averaged together in order to obtain a single estimate.
The results are recorded in table~\ref{tbl:velocities}.
\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{Wave velocities in the \acs{rpnd}.}
  \label{tbl:velocities}
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule                                                      \\
    Pressure  & Upstream                & Downstream              \\
    (Torr)    & Velocity (m/s)          & Velocity (m/s)          \\
    \midrule                                                      \\
    8.0       & $3.01\pm1.21\times10^7$ & $1.73\pm0.26\times10^7$ \\
    16.0      & $1.46\pm0.19\times10^7$ & $6.80\pm1.75\times10^6$ \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Ultimately, only the 8.0 and 16.0 Torr conditions exhibited any statistically
significant delay in the emission signals. For all other cases, the wave
velocity exceeded the maximum detectable value. The results are comparable to
other measurements made for similar discharges. The early work of Schonland and
Collens \cite{Schonland1933} determined that the luminous front of lightning
propagated with a velocity of 0.72 and 5.3$\times10^7$ m/s for the forward and
return stroke respectively. The studies reported by Vasilyak et al.
\cite{Vasilyak1994} give a range of approximately $2-5\times10^7$ m/s for a 200
kV \acs{fiw} in helium at pressures from 0.1-760 Torr. Propagation velocities
for atmospheric plasma jets of helium have been measured at about $10^5$ m/s
\cite{Lu2006} with simulations providing confirmation \cite{Naidis2010} of these
values. Fast imaging by Ito et al. \cite{Ito2010} determined a velocity of
$10^6$ m/s for a hydrogen \acs{rpnd}.

\section{Electron Temperatures}

Measurement of the electron temperature in \acs{rpnd}s poses a large difficulty
for several reasons. The most significant of which is the concept of temperature
itself. As was noted in Chapter~\ref{chp:modeling}, the \acs{rpnd} is a highly
dynamic system which does not necessarily result in a population of electrons
with a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. In the absence of this property, the
``temperature'' quantity can have an ambiguous meaning. Often, reported
temperatures will describe the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution which best matches
some specified plasma property (such as plasma emissions). In other cases, the
temperature may describe the mean electron energy of the \acs{eedf}, such as in
Chapter~\ref{chp:modeling} or in the work of Starikovskaia and Starikovskii
\cite{Starikovskaia2001}.

The temperatures generated in these two cases will coincide only for a limited
number of situations and certain diagnostics. Thus, it is of interest to search
for useful electron temperature diagnostics which could be used for the
\acs{rpnd}. The electron temperature of a plasma is most often determined by the
use of electrostatic probes, such as Langmuir probes \cite{Lieberman2005}.
However, as was discussed at the beginning of Chapter~\ref{chp:metastables},
physical probes are not a reasonable option of the \acs{rpnd}. An active optical
technique, such as Thomson scattering \cite{VanGessel2012}, would be an ideal
solution if the electron densities in the \acs{rpnd} were not below its
sensitivity threshold.

Without the option of physical probes or active spectroscopic techniques,
several attempts were made to translate the measured plasma emission results to
electron temperatures. Such techniques have been successful in the analysis of
steady-state systems with relatively low electron densities \cite{Kunze2009},
however they are subject to several limitations. The largest of these is the
need for a measurable amount of emissions. However, the \acs{rpnd} emissions
only last for a few hundred nanoseconds. The second limitation is the finite
lifetime of the excited states. This places a physical limit on the time
resolution of passive optical electron temperature measurements. Given these
issues, the use of such techniques must be carefully considered and qualified.

\subsection{Boltzmann Plots}

The first attempt to determine the electron density of the \acs{rpnd} involved
the use of a Boltzmann plot. When the \acs{eedf} is a Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution and the population of two excited states are in equilibrium with
the electrons (partial local thermodynamic equilibrium, \acs{plte}), the ratio
of their densities and line intensities can be written as \cite{Griem2005}
\begin{equation}
  R = \frac{I_{i,j}N_j}{I_{i',j'}N_{j'}}
    \approx \frac{\lambda_{i,j}A_{i,j}g_j}{\lambda_{i',j'}A_{i',j'}g_{j'}}
            \exp\left( -\frac{\Delta\epsilon_{i,j} - \Delta\epsilon_{i',j'}}
                      {\kB T_e} \right),
\end{equation}
where $I$ is the line intensity, $N$ is the density, the subscripts represent
different electronic states, $\lambda$ is the transition wavelength, $A$ is the
spontaneous transition rate, $g$ is statistical degeneracy, and $\Delta\epsilon$
is the energy separation between the identified states. As can be seen, this
ratio only depends tabulated physical quantities for helium and the electron
temperatures.

This ratio can be transformed to obtain the relation
\begin{equation}
  \log\left(\frac{I_{i,j}\lambda_{i,j}}{g_jA_{ij}}\right)
  \propto -\frac{$\Delta\epsilon_{i,j}$}{\kB T_e}.
\end{equation}
Therefore a plot of the logarithmic quantity with respect to the transition
energy would yield a line with a slope equal to the negative reciprocal of the
electron temperature. The use of several lines for this Boltzmann plot obviates
the need for absolute density measurements and makes for a more accurate
determination of the slope of the line. However, it also extends the requirement
for \acs{plte} to additional combinations of excited states.

In order to evaluate this method, Boltzmann plots were generated for both the
measured and simulated emissions data. Each set of states were assumed to be in
\acs{plte}. At each time step, a line was fitted to the data with a
least-squares algorithm, and the electron temperature was calculated. This
produced the temperature estimates seen in figure~\ref{fig:boltcomp}.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/emissions/figures/boltcomp.eps}
  \caption{Temperatures estimated using Boltzmann plots of the measured emissions
    (dashed, red lines) and simulated emissions (dotted, blue lines) compared to
    the simulated temperatures (solid, black line).}
  \label{fig:boltcomp}
\end{figure}
The limited intensity of the plasma emissions prevented temperature estimates
for the experimental data soon after the pulse. Even after the emission
intensities rose to adequate values, the electron temperature estimates appeared
to be provide poor results for the duration of the measurement period. Peak
temperatures were underestimated by at least a factor of ten, if not more.

This disagreement is not altogether unexpected. Even in the ideal case of
electron with a fixed temperature, \acs{plte} only occurs after each electron
has undergone many collisions with atoms in the gas. The changes in electron
temperatures of the \acs{rpnd} occur too rapidly for this kind of equilibrium to
occur. This is true, not only for the actual \acs{rpnd}, but the simulation as
well.

Based on this reasoning, it might be expected that the validity of the Boltzmann
plot approach would improve as the time increased. While this is eventually
true, it does not appear that the \acs{rpnd} afterglow ever reaches the point
where the all the states associated with the measured transitions reach
\acs{plte}. For the results shown, the Boltzmann plots for the measured and
simulated emissions continue to under-predict the electron temperatures well
into the afterglow. This reflects Kunze's statement that ``one always has to
check if indeed the assumption of a Boltzmann distribution is justified \ldots,
equilibrium may not be reached even if the steady-state conditions seem to
indicate that.'' \cite{Kunze2009}

Given this analysis, Boltzmann plots appear to be poor indicators of the
electron temperatures within an \acs{rpnd}. Though the results may improve as
the time after the pulse increases, it is possible that the emissions will fall
below detectable limits well before \acs{plte} applies. This is emphasized by an
examination of the individual Boltzmann plots, figure~\ref{fig:boltex}, obtained
from the measurements.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/emissions/figures/boltex.eps}
  \caption{Boltzmann plot examples for the \acs{rpnd}}
  \label{fig:boltex}
\end{figure}
Each plot possesses many deviations from the straight line which would indicate
the applicability of \acs{plte}. 

\subsection{Coronal Model}

The failure of the \acs{plte} assumption indicates the need for a different
model in the determination of the electron temperature. One such model is the
coronal model. In this case, the excited states are all assumed to be generated
by electron collisions with ground state atoms. However, these excited states
decay by optical emission. This model excels at electron low densities where
states are not subject to a great degree of mixing and inter-atomic collisions
can be neglected \cite{Kunze2009}. As with \acs{plte}, it is not immediately
clear that these assumptions hold for the \acs{rpnd}.

Per Kunze \cite{Kunze2009}, the line intensity ratio resulting from the coronal
model may be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \frac{I_{i,j}}{I_{i',j'}} = \frac{\lambda_{i',j'}A_{i,j}\sum A_{i'} K_{0,i}(T_e)}
  {\lambda_{i,j}A_{i',j'}\sum A_{i} K_{0,i'}(T_e)}
\end{equation}
where the sum is over all possible radiative decay pathways, the subscript `0'
is the ground state, and $K$ is the rate coefficient. Note that the rate
coefficients are explicitly functions of the electron temperature. As with the
global model, the rate coefficients must be calculated from the interaction
cross sections with an assumed \acs{eedf}. For consistency, we assume that this
is a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The upper states used for this line ratio
must be carefully chosen so as to limit sensitivity to collisional mixing of
excited states. Likewise, the rate coefficient ratio should exhibit a monotonic
trend with electron temperature.

Several ratios have been suggested by Kunze and others, including:
4$^3$S-2$^3$P$\odd$ over 4$^1$S-2$^1$P$\odd$, 3$^3$S-2$^3$P$\odd$ over
3$^1$S-2$^1$P$\odd$, and 4$^3$S-2$^3$P$\odd$ over 4$^1$D-2$^1$P$\odd$. The
ratios with the upper state in an S subshell are attractive as they are less
have the lowest energy for a given $n$ and thus are less susceptible to
collisional mixing between states of equal $n$ \cite{Kunze2009}. However,
limited emission intensity prevented accurate measurements of the
4$^1$S-2$^1$P$\odd$ transition. As a result, only the former two ratios were
considered for analysis.

Like the other mentioned ratios, 4$^3$S-2$^3$P$\odd$ over 4$^1$D-2$^1$P$\odd$
compares a transition from the triplet manifold to one from the singlet
manifold. Triplet-singlet ratios have been found to be mostly dependent to
electron temperature which makes them ideal for this purpose \cite{Griem2005}.
Figure~\ref{fig:conversion}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/emissions/figures/conversion.eps}
  \caption{The emission ratios of 4$^3$S-2$^3$P$\odd$ over 4$^1$D-2$^1$P$\odd$ 
    and 3$^3$S-2$^3$P$\odd$ over 3$^1$S-2$^1$P$\odd$, as functions of the
    electron temperature.}
  \label{fig:conversion}
\end{figure}
shows the relation between the emission intensity of the two transitions and the
electron temperature of the system. The rate coefficients were calculated with
the assumption of a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, using the cross sections
produced by Ralchenko et al. \cite{Ralchenko2008}. 

These calculations for the triplet-singlet ratios were used to estimate the
electron temperature from the simulated emissions as well as the measured
emissions. As with the Boltzmann plots, the temperatures calculated from the
simulated emissions represent the best attainable result with this method. The
results obtained with the 4$^3$S-2$^3$P$\odd$ to 4$^1$D-2$^1$P$\odd$ ratio, seen
in figure~\ref{fig:rat2com},
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/emissions/figures/rat2comp.eps}
  \caption{Estimates of the electron temperatures based on the ratio of the
    4$^3$S-2$^3$P$\odd$ and 4$^1$D-2$^1$P$\odd$ transitions. The estimates were
    generated for the simulated emissions (dotted, blue lines) and measured
    emissions (dashed, red lines), and are compared to the actual temperature
    results from the global model simulation (solid, black lines).}
  \label{fig:rat2comp}
\end{figure}
were not promising. As before, neither the simulated nor the measured ratios
proved to provide good estimates of the electron temperatures. However, unlike
the Boltzmann plots, this line ratio generally resulted in an overestimate of
the temperatures. The relation from figure~\ref{fig:conversion} shows that the
low triplet-singlet ratios are associated with high temperatures. This suggests
either an excess in 4$^1$D states, or a deficit of 4$^3$S states. Additionally,
both the measured and simulated ratios show growing or otherwise elevated
temperature well after the pulse. This may be partially explained by the use of
the 4$^1$D state for the singlet transition, an approach warned against by Kunze
\cite{Kunze2009}.

Also notable is the disagreement between the measured and simulated ratios.
While the temperatures estimated from the measurements quickly decrease after
the pulse, the temperatures from the simulations continue to rise. This
situation reverses at about 75 ns when the temperature estimates from the
measurements begin to rise while the simulated ones fall. The reason for this
difference in behavior is not immediately clear, however Boivin et al.\ reported
several problems with this line ratio which they attributed to the omission of
$n=5$ states from their simulations \cite{Boivin2007}. 

Unlike the prior line ratio, a comparison of 3$^3$S-2$^3$P$\odd$ to
3$^1$S-2$^1$P$\odd$, eliminates the potentially problematic upper state in the D
subshell. Additionally, the lower $n$ results in a greater energy spacing
between the different subshells. For both of these reasons, this ratio should be
less susceptible to collisional mixing. While the lower threshold energies make
this ratio less desirable for very high electron temperatures, it was believed
to be more than adequate for the \acs{rpnd}. This reasoning is somewhat borne
out by the results in figure~\ref{fig:rat1comp}.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/emissions/figures/rat1comp.eps}
  \caption{Estimates of the electron temperatures based on the ratio of the
    3$^3$S-2$^3$P$\odd$ to 3$^1$S-2$^1$P$\odd$, transitions. The estimates were
    generated for the simulated emissions (dotted, blue lines) and measured
    emissions (dashed, red lines), and are compared to the actual temperature
    results from the global model simulation (solid, black lines).}
  \label{fig:rat1comp}
\end{figure}
The temperature estimates based on the simulated emissions show excellent
agreement with the temperatures from the global model. This is true both in
terms of the magnitude of the values and the overall behavior of the trends. The
initial increase in temperature is captured particularly well, with only
moderate deviations in the afterglow. These differences are believe to be the
result of the radiative cascade from higher excited states which contribute to
the population of the upper excited states, mildly violating the coronal model.

Unfortunately, the experimental results do not share the exceptional qualities
of the estimates from the simulated emissions. In part, this can be attributed
to the experimental difficulties. The two transitions occur at wavelengths to
which the \acs{pmt} is noticeably less sensitive. As a result, the absolute
intensities of these lines were particularly low. This led to substantial
uncertainties in the line ratios which persisted throughout the measurement
period.

Of the available data, the two transitions were most intense at 4.0 Torr. As a
result, this represents the most reliable electron temperature estimates based
on this line ratio. In contrast to the temperature from the global model, the
emission measurements suggest that the temperature peaks at 4.9 eV followed by a
rapid relaxation to about 0.5 eV. If accurate, the fast relaxation of the
electrons suggests that additional inelastic processes should be considered by
the global model. The most likely reservoir for this energy would be the excited
states of molecular nitrogen which composes the majority of the impurities in
the system.

Given the low intensities, difficulty in obtaining accurate intensity
measurements \cite{Griem2005}, and the sensitivity of the temperature estimate
to the line ratio, these results should be considered quite preliminary. The use
of these transitions is promising for measurements of the electron temperature
in the \acs{rpnd}--the global model simulations show a good agreement between
the estimates and the actual temperatures, and the ratio changes quickly enough
to capture at least some of the \acs{rpnd} dynamics. Improvements to the
spectral sensitivity at these wavelengths could confirm the above results and
indicate necessary modifications to the global model.

\section{Emission Comparisons}

The emission curves of the simulated and experimental \acs{rpnd} contain a
number of minor and significant differences. Likewise, some provide meaningful
insight on the plasma characteristics, others are more ambiguous. For example,
the greater than expected prominence of the 4$^3$D-2$^3$P$\odd$ transition may
either indicate a more substantial high energy electron tail, or the need for
the inclusion of $n=5$ states. Two differences will be analyzed here, however
the full set of emission measurements are available in
Appendix~\ref{chp:extraem}.

\subsection{Excitation Duration}

As was noted in Chapter~\ref{chp:modeling}, several assumptions were needed to
develop the global model used to simulate the \acs{rpnd}. Among these were the
assumption that the \acs{eedf} was always a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, and
that the applied electric field was a Gaussian function in time with a width of
40 ns. The \acs{pic} simulations as well as the results from Boltzmann plots and
line ratios have already suggested that the former assumption is not rigorously
true. While the electric field shape was originally inferred from the
observation of a return stroke in the system, this assumption was considered in
more detail via the 3$^1$D-2$^1$P$\odd$ transition at 668 nm.

Figure~\ref{fig:667comp}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/emissions/figures/667comp.eps}
  \caption{Comparison of the measured and simulated emissions from the
  3$^1$D-2$^1$P$\odd$ transition at pressures of 1.0, 4.0, and 8.0 Torr.}
  \label{fig:667comp}
\end{figure}
features a comparison of the measured and simulated emissions for the
3$^1$D-2$^1$P$\odd$ transition over the range of simulated pressures. Both sets
of results have been normalized to the maximum value of the 4.0 Torr transition
so that the relative trends could be compared. 

This transition was initially chosen for investigation because it was
particularly prominent in both the measured and simulated emissions.
Additionally, at $n=3$, the upper state is below the maximum $n$ considered in
the global model. Therefore, the evolution of the upper state density and its
emission curve reflects re-population effects as a result of radiative decay
from $n=4$. Finally, the comparative behavior of the emission curves is
representative of most of the other transitions.

The simulations and the experimental measurements share a number general
features. The optical intensity peaks at 4.0 Torr, followed by 1.0 Torr, and
lastly, by 8.0 Torr. The relative magnitude of the optical intensities also
agree for times greater than 50 ns after the pulse. Additionally, the timing of
the peaks are also consistent between the two sets of data. It is interesting to
note that this occurs in part because of the long delay before the onset of the
emissions in the 1.0 Torr simulation.

Despite the similarities, there are several notable differences. As already
mentioned, there is a significant delay prior to the appearance of emissions
from the 1.0 Torr simulation. This is probably caused by the low pre-pulse
electron density in the 1.0 Torr case--approximately two orders of magnitude
less than the other cases. Though this value is believed to be accurate, this
behavior must be reconciled with that of the observed emissions which all appear
at approximately the same time.

Also observable is an apparent pressure dependence for the rate at which the
measured emissions grew. At 1.0 Torr, the emissions took noticeably longer to
reach their peak intensity as compared to the measurements at 8.0 Torr, or 4.0
Torr which was the fastest. This is similar to what appeared to be a relatively
slow growth in the metastable density at 1.0 Torr, as seen in
figure~\ref{fig:nmcomp}. Again, this suggests that something unexpected is
occurring at the 1.0 Torr condition. To some extent, the behavior of the
emissions and the metastable densities almost appear to be the result of a
broadening of the applied voltage pulse. Similarly broad emission curves were
observed in the 0.5 and 0.3 Torr experiments as well.

Another important difference is the post-pulse shape of the curves. The
simulated emissions, after reaching their peak, have decays which could be best
described by a superposition of a fast and a slow exponential. This behavior--a
fast decay following the pulse followed by a slow exponential, is similar to the
behavior of the electron temperature from figure~\ref{fig:etemps}. It seems
likely that the two are related as the fast fall in electron temperature would
result in a fall of the excitation rate of the 3$^1$D state, reducing its
emissions.

By comparison, each of the measured emission curves are best matched by a single
exponential decay process. While the slow exponential decay rate of the
simulated results is relatively constant across pressures, there is a distinct
pressure dependence in the measured emissions. This tends to suggest some type
of atomic collision process as the global model provides a relatively complete
accounting for the electron collision processes. Likewise, excitation transfer
processes were also considered. The next most likely candidate would by the
impurities within the system which were not included in the model. 

\subsection{Radiation Trapping}

Another phenomena which may alter the shape of the observed emissions is
radiation trapping. The basis for this process is stimulated absorption, the
same as laser-absorption spectroscopy, however radiation trapping occurs in the
absence of any external photon field. Consider a photon emitted in a plasma by
excited atomic state transitioning to one of lower energy. If this photon
encounters an atom in the same lower state, it stands some finite chance of
re-absorption before exiting the plasma. Re-absorption would lead to the
excitation of the atom and eventually the isotropic emission of a second photon
\cite{Kunze2009}.

This isotropic emission makes radiation trapping a random-walk process which can
effectively increase the residence time of energy within a plasma. From an
observers perspective, radiation trapping manifests as a longer than expected
radiative lifetime. As the probability of re-absorption per unit path-length is
proportional to the density of the lower atomic state, radiation trapping is
most significant for transitions from an excited state to ground. This makes the
$^1$P states the most susceptible to trapping in a helium plasma.

As these transitions involve deep-UV emissions, they were not directly
observable with the previously described setup. However, as radiation trapping
results in an effective increase of the lifetime for the atomic states involved
there should be a corresponding increase in the intensity and duration of other
transitions involving the $^1$P states. Therefore the simulated and experimental
emissions for the 3$^1$P$\odd$-3$^1$S transition were compared. In addition, the
3$^3$P$\odd$-3$^3$S transition, whose upper state does not have a transition to
ground, were plotted to provide a baseline for comparison.

\end{figure}
shows the results of this comparison. As can be seen, the triplet transition
shows relatively good agreement between the simulated and experimental
emissions. The decay rates are comparable at 1.0 and 4.0 Torr, though there is
some discrepancy at 8.0 Torr. However, a similar comparison of the results for
the singlet transition reveals a very different case. The simulated emissions
from the transition die away almost immediately as a result of the large $A$
coefficient for the 3$^1$P-1$^1$S transition, 5.66$\times10^{8}$ s$^{-1}$. In
contrast, the measured emissions for this state have decay rates which are
generally similar to those for the triplet transition. This appears to confirm
the effects of radiation trapping on the measured emissions.

The importance of radiation trapping has previously been considered by Compton
\cite{compton1922} and later by Holstein \cite{Holstein1947, Holstein1951}.
Holstein's work allowed the calculation of an effective lifetime for trapped
radiation in the form of the nominal radiative lifetime, multiplied by a
trapping factor. The trapping factor is dependent on the geometry and the
lineshape of the transition. For an infinite cylinder primarily subject to
Doppler broadening, the trapping factor may be written as
\begin{equation}
  T = \frac{k_0R\left[\pi\log(k_0R)\right]^{1/2}}{1.6},
\end{equation}
where $R$ is the radius of the cylinder and $k_0$ is the absorption coefficient
at the line center,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\lambda_0^3N_1}{8\pi} \frac{g_2}{g_1} \frac{A_{21}}{\pi^{1/2}v_\mathrm{th}}.
\end{equation}
Here, $\lambda_0$ is the transition wavelength, $N_1$ is the density of lower
resonant state, $g$ is the statistical degeneracy of the upper and lower states,
and $A$ is the natural radiative lifetime. For a gas temperature of 300 K and a
radius of 1.65 cm, the resulting trapping coefficients and effective lifetimes
of the 3$^1$P-1$^1$S transition are listed in table~\ref{tbl:lifetimes}.

\end{table}
For comparison, the normal lifetime of this transition is about 1.77 ns.
Therefore, even at these moderate pressures, energy entering the 3$^1$P state
can remain in the system for an exceptionally period of time. A similar
conclusion may be made regarding the 2$^1$P and 4$^1$P states.

The conclusion that radiation trapping occurs within the \acs{rpnd} is not
surprising given the relatively high pressure of operation. However, the
magnitude of the phenomena is larger than expected with the effective lifetimes
approaching the pulse period. The long persistence of energy in the $^1$P states
at higher pressures may provide ample opportunity for collisional redistribution
to one of the two metastable states. The importance of this effect will clearly
grow as \acs{rpnd} operating pressures increase.

\section{Summary}

The active spectroscopy used to measure the metastable densities within the
\acs{rpnd} and the subsequent modeling provided a number of insights on its
development. Passive spectroscopy was then used to provide further information
on the development of the discharge. Initial analysis of the emissions indicated
that the wave developed with a velocity of 1.7-3.0$\times10^7$ m/s at 8.0 Torr
and 0.7-1.5$\times10^7$ m/s at 16.0 Torr. All other operating conditions
developed with velocities in excess of 5.0$\times10^7$ m/s.

Estimates of the wave velocity were followed by several attempts to determine
the evolution of the electron temperature in the \acs{rpnd}. This included the
use of Boltzmann plots (with the corresponding assumption of \acs{plte}), as
well as line ratios based on the coronal excitation model. The Boltzmann plot
method proved to be a poor and unreliable indicator of electron temperature in
the system. Examination of the individual Boltzmann plots revealed that the
excited states were far from \acs{plte}. Attempts to use the ratio of the
4$^3$S-2$^3$P$\odd$ to the 4$^1$D-2$^1$P$\odd$ transition also proved to provide
poor estimates of the electron temperature from both simulated and measured
emission values. Eventually the ratio of 3$^3$S-2$^3$P$\odd$ over
3$^1$S-2$^1$P$\odd$, was shown to provide good estimates of the electron
temperature based on the simulated emissions. Unfortunately, uncertainties in
the experimental emission measurements limited any conclusion on its
effectiveness with the \acs{rpnd}.

The emissions of the \acs{rpnd} were further analyzed for three transitions. The
measured and simulated 3$^1$D-2$^1$P$\odd$ emissions were considered because of
their prominence and representative nature. General trends such as the relative
emission intensities and timing of the peak intensities were consistent between
the simulations and measurements. However, several significant differences also
appeared. The decay of the experimental emissions featured a strong pressure
dependence which was not present in the simulated emissions. It was speculated
that this resulted from collisional processes with impurities. Additionally, the
1.0 Torr measurements showed an unusually extended excitation period. This trend
continued to the lower pressures, and the metastable trends at 1.0 Torr provided
support for this extended excitation period. The reason for this change in
behavior at low pressures is not entirely clear.

Finally, the emissions from the 3$^1$P$\odd$-3$^1$S transition were compared to
those from the 3$^3$P$\odd$-3$^3$S transition in search of evidence for
radiation trapping. A comparison of the measured and simulated emissions
illustrated the prevalence of radiation trapping at 1.0, 4.0, and 8.0 Torr. This
was confirmed by subsequent calculations of the effective radiative lifetime for
the 3$^1$P state. Aside from the observable impact on the plasma emissions,
the increased effective lifetimes of the $^1$P almost certainly contribute to
additional metastable excitation as well as ionization. The importance of these
effects should increase with the \acs{rpnd} operating pressure and may play an
important role in maintaining the stability of the \acs{rpnd} between pulses.
