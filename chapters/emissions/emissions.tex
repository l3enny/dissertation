The global model was used to infer the electric field, electron densities, and
electron temperatures in the \acs{rpnd} from the metastable measurements.
However, as was described in the development of the model, it is also capable of
predicting the densities of other excited states and the optical emissions of
the \acs{rpnd}. This chapter will describe the measurement of the optical
emissions of the \acs{rpnd} and then the use of these measurements to determine
the \acs{rpnd} wave velocity and electrons temperatures. Finally, the electron
temperatures and the spectral trends will be compared to those obtained from the
global model.
