\section{Ionized Gas}
A plasma is considered to be a form or subset of ionized gas. That is, a
volume of neutral atoms or molecules, of which some fraction has been
separated into electrons and ions. For a sufficiently large number of
particles, the behavior of each species in the ionized gas can be
described by a continuous distribution function which specifies the
number of particles with a specific range of velocities, in a specific
volume, at a specific time. This function is denoted
$f_\alpha(\vec{r_\alpha}, \vec{v_\alpha}, t)$, where the subscript
$\alpha$ denotes the species, $f$ is the probability distribution,
$\vec{r}$ is the position, $\vec{v}$ is the velocity, and $t$ is the
time.

The behavior of $f_\alpha$ can be shown to be governed by the
Vlasov-Fokker-Planck (\acs{vfp}) equation,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:vfp}
  \frac{\partial f_\alpha}{\partial t} + \vec{v_\alpha}\cdot\nabla f_\alpha +
  q_\alpha \left(\vec{E} + \vec{v_\alpha}\times\vec{B}\right)
  \cdot \nabla_\mathrm{v} f_\alpha = \left( \frac{\partial f_\alpha}
  {\partial t}\right)_\mathrm{coll}.
\end{equation}
Here, $q$ is the charge of the species, $\vec{E}$ is the electric field,
$\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field, and $\partial f_\alpha/(\partial
t)_\mathrm{coll}$ is a term which represents changes to the distribution
function as a result of collisions. The \acs{vfp} is a rigorous kinetic
description of an ionized gas. Coupled with Maxwell's equations, it is
can provide a complete and self-consistent description of the particle
densities in an ionized gas as well as the electric and magnetic fields.

For a species in equilibrium in the absence of external forces
(($\partial f_\alpha/\partial t)_\mathrm{coll} = 0$) it can be shown
that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mb}
  f_\alpha(v_\alpha) =
    n_\alpha\left( \frac{m_\alpha}{2\pi \kB T_\alpha}\right)^{3/2}
   \exp\left(-\frac{m_\alpha v_\alpha^2}{2\kB T_\alpha}\right),
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the total density of the species, $m$ is the particle mass,
$\kB$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T_\mathrm{alpha}$ is the temperature
of the species. It must be emphasized that this solution only applies to
situations where the species can be considered to be in equilibrium.
Strong gradients and large electromagnetic fields can both drive a
distribution far from its equilibrium condition. This is particularly
important when plasmas are discussed in the context of temperature.

Solutions of the \acs{vfp} in anything but this simple case can be very
challenging. It most situations, it is reduced to more tenable equations
by integrating over the velocity-space (leaving $f$ as only a function of
space and time). The first so-called moment is often called the conservation
equation or continuity equation,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cont}
  \frac{\partial n_\alpha}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (n_\alpha \vec{u_\alpha})
  = G_\alpha - L_\alpha.
\end{equation}
In this case, $\vec{v}$ has been replaced by a mean velocity $\vec{u}$.
We have also introduced terms losses ($L$) and gains ($G$) in the
species density.

The definition of the mean velocity can be obtained by multiplying the
\acs{vfp} equation by $v$ and integrating over velocity-space. This is
referred to as the second moment. The result is an equation expressing
the conservation of momentum for the species. The actual equation will
not be reproduced here, but it forms the basis for the two-fluid
approximation of a plasma. In the course of developing the second
moment an additional term, the pressure tensor, is introduced which can
only be defined by the third moment of the \acs{vfp} equation. In fact,
each additional moment introduces a new term, \emph{ad infinitum}. For
most cases, the first two or three moments suffice, after the sequence
is terminated by the use of an additional assumption.

For our purposes, one more moment will suffice. Multiplying by $mv^2/2$,
integrating over velocity-space, and assuming that the pressure is
isotropic, produces the energy conservation equation,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{3}{2}p_\alpha\right) 
  + \nabla\cdot\frac{3}{2} (p_\alpha\vec{u}_\alpha)
  + p_\alpha\nabla\cdot\vec{u}_\alpha
  + \nabla\cdot\vec{q}_\alpha
  = \frac{\partial}{\partial
  t}\left(\frac{3}{2}p_\alpha\right)\bigg|_\mathrm{coll}.
\end{equation}
In this case, $p$ represents the plasma pressure, and $\vec{q}$ is the
heat flow. The first term on the \textsc{lhs} represents the total
energy contained by the species, the second term is the energy flux in
and out of the volume, and the third term accounts for changes due to
compression or expansion. The \textsc{rhs} is the collision operator
which describes energy added or removed from the system as a result of
collisions.

\section{Plasma Criteria}
Previously, it was stated that plasmas were a form of ionized gas. 

To a large extent, a plasma can be categorized based on its electron
temperature and density. Figure~\ref{fig:regimes}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/theory/figures/regimes.eps}
  \caption{Illustration of the various regimes of plasma in terms of
electron temperature and density \cite{Huba2011}.}
  \label{fig:regimes}
\end{figure}
shows where a number of different types of plasmas fall based on this
classification. As can be seen, the electron temperature of a plasma can
cross seven orders of magnitude, and the density can extend over 20.
While a plasma is often described as an ionized gas, the two are not
interchangeable; ionization of a gas is a necessary, but not sufficient
condition for a plasma. There are three additional criteria which are
used to identify a plasma.

\subsection{$\lambda_\mathrm{D} < L$}
An ionized gas is composed of both positive and negative charges,
usually ions and electrons, respectively. When an electrical
perturbation is introduced, the electrons and ions will arrange
themselves so as to screen or shield the perturbation. This causes the
electric field of the perturbation to fall off more rapidly than the
typical $r^{-2}$. The length scale of this shielding effect is referred
to as the Debye length, denoted $\lambda_\mathrm{D}$. The Debye length
can be shown to be equal to $\sqrt{\epsilon_0T_\mathrm{e}/(en_0)}$,
where $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, $T_\mathrm{e}$ is the
electron temperature, and $n_\mathrm{e}$ is the electron density.

\subsection{$n(4/3\pi r^3) >> 1$}
\subsection{$\omega_p > \nu$}

\section{Atomic Spectroscopy}

Spectroscopy spans a large body of theory which cannot be adequately
covered here. Given that the measurements are all for helium, we will
limit ourselves to a simple description of atomic spectroscopy. An atom
is made of positively charged nucleus and a number of negatively charged
electrons which orbit this nucleus. In the unperturbed, or ground state,
the electrons occupy orbitals determined by a full solution of the
Schrodinger equation.

However, interactions with other particles or photons can excite one or
more of the electrons into orbitals with higher potential energy. In
most cases relevant to low temperature plasmas, only a single electron
will be excited at any given time. Depending on which orbital the
electron is excited to, it can transition to orbitals with lower
potential energy by emitting a photon. These are typically called
allowed transitions.

Each orbital in an atom can be described by four quantum numbers.
\begin{itemize}
  \item $n$ - The principal quantum number.
  \item $l$ - Orbital angular momentum number.
  \item $j$ - Total angular momentum.
  \item $m_j$ - Total angular magnetic moment.
\end{itemize}
The Pauli exclusion principle restricts more than a single electron from
occupying any given state defined by this series of numbers.
Additionally, each set of numbers determines the potential energy
possessed by an electron in that particular level. 

Allowed transitions are determined by a series of selection rules. These
selection rules can be summed up as the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\Delta S = 0$
    \item $\Delta L = \pm1$
\end{itemize}
Though other transitions are possible (spin and dipole forbidden respectively),
they tend to require an external perturbation in order to induce transition.

Figure shows the what is commonly called a Grotrian diagram for helium.
In this diagram, the vertical axis represents the energy above the
ground state, and the levels are arranged horizontally based on
increasing $L$. Levels which are radiatively linked are connected by
solid lines. As can be seen in this figure, only the levels having $S=1$
are radiatively connected to the ground state. As a result, any helium
atoms that are excited into the triplet manifold tend to stay there,
accumulating in the metastable state, $2^3S$.

Approaching 24 eV, the excited electron enters what is known as the continuum.
The energy separation between states goes as $n^{-2}$, thus at large $n$ the
spacing becomes quite close and the states are almost indistinguishable. The
levels are often referred to as Ryberg states. Above 24.69 eV, the electron
becomes totally detached from the helium nucleus, and all that remains is
a singly ionized helium atom.

Though the emissions of ions can be quite useful in some plasmas, we do not
concern ourselves with them in either the measurements or models. 24.69 eV is
the largest known ionization potential, and as a result, the number of ions and
the emissions associated with them remain relatively small.

\subsection{Spectral Lineshapes}
It is tempting to think that the energy spacing can be calculated exactly,
however there is always some variance about a central energy. This is called the
spectral lineshape, and it effects both the energy of the emitted photon in
radiative transitions, and the photons that an atom can absorb. Though these
variations can be attributed to quantum mechanical effects, the actual result
can derived from the so-called dipole approximation.

In this case, we envision a single electron oscillating about a large, heavy,
positive charge. The full details of this derivation are covered in Siegman
\cite{Siegman1986}, however we'll address some of the most pertinent portions
here. The response of a collection of atoms to an applied electric field can be
expressed as a quantity known as the susceptibility. This is generally defined
as
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\chi}(\omega) \equiv
    \frac{\tilde{P}(\omega)}{\epsilon_0\tilde{E}(\omega)}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{\chi}$ is the electric susceptibility, $\tilde{P}$ is the
macroscopic polarization, $\tilde{E}$ is the applied electric field, and
$\omega$ is the frequency of the applied field.

\paragraph{Natural Linewidth}
The electric susceptibility often possesses both a real and imaginary component.
Physically, these respectively represent the reactive and absorptive component
of the medium. Accounting for level-dependent effects, the standard
susceptibility for an atomic transition can be written as
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\chi}_\mathrm{at}(\omega) = -j\frac{3}{4\pi^2}\frac{\Delta
    N\lambda^3\gamma_\mathrm{rad}}{\Delta\omega_\mathrm{a}}\frac{1}{1
    + 2j(\omega - \omega_\mathrm{a})/\Delta\omega}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta N$ represents the population difference between the upper and
lower levels of the oscillator, $\lambda$ is the transition wavelength,
$\gamma_\mathrm{rad}$ is the natural radiative lifetime of the oscillator,
$\Delta\omega_\mathrm{a}$ is the linewidth of the transition (for an unperturbed
atom, this is simply $\gamma_\mathrm{rad}$), and $\omega_\mathrm{a}$ is the
angular frequency of the transition or oscillator.

This equation is generally known as the complex lorentzian. Separated into its
components it expresses both the absorptive and reactive properties of the
atomic medium. It also clearly susceptible to fields that are displaced from
$\omega_\mathrm{a}$. This is the finite linewidth associated with atomic
emissions and absorption.

This linewidth affects each atom within the medium. Each atom will emit or
absorb radiation with a probability described by this susceptibility.
Consequently, this natural linewidth falls under the homogeneous category of
line broadening.

\paragraph{Pressure Broadening}
Also included in this category is pressure broadening, or more fundamentally,
dephasing.
