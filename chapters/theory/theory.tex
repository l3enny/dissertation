\section{Ionized Gas}
A plasma is considered to be a form or subset of ionized gas. That is, a volume
of gas in which some fraction of the neutral atoms and/or molecules have been
separated into electron and ion pairs. For a sufficiently large number of
particles, the behavior of each species in the ionized gas can be described by a
continuous distribution function.

This probability distribution expresses the likelihood of finding a particle
with a specific range of velocities in a specific volume, as a function of time.
This function is denoted as $f_\alpha(\vec{r}, \vec{v}, t)$, where
the subscript $\alpha$ denotes the species, $f$ is the probability distribution,
$\vec{r}$ is the position, $\vec{v}$ is the velocity, and $t$ is the time.

The behavior of $f_\alpha$ can be shown to be governed by the Boltzmann
equation,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:boltzmann}
  \frac{\partial f_\alpha}{\partial t} + \vec{v}\cdot\nabla f_\alpha +
  q_\alpha \left(\vec{E} + \vec{v}\times\vec{B}\right)
  \cdot \nabla_v f_\alpha = \left( \frac{\partial f_\alpha}
  {\partial t}\right)_\mathrm{coll}.
\end{equation}
Here, $q$ is the charge of the species, $\vec{E}$ is the electric field,
$\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field, and $\partial f_\alpha/(\partial
t)_\mathrm{coll}$ is a term which represents changes to the distribution
function as a result of collisions. Coupled with Maxwell's equations,
equation~\ref{eq:boltzmann} provides a complete description of the behavior of
the fields and particles in a plasma.

For a species in equilibrium in the absence of external forces and ($\partial
f_\alpha/\partial t)_\mathrm{coll} = 0$, it can be shown that the distribution
of energies is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mb}
  f_{\alpha}(\epsilon) = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}(\kB T_\alpha)^{-3/2}
                        \exp{\left(-\frac{3\epsilon}{2\kB T_\alpha}\right)}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon$ is the energy, $\kB$ is Boltzmann's constant, and $T_\alpha$ is
the temperature of the species. This is referred to as the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution. It should be emphasized that this solution only applies when the
species can be considered to be in equilibrium. Gradients and electromagnetic
fields can both significantly alter the distribution function of a species. This
can be of particular importance in the calculation or reaction rates, or the
measurement of temperatures.

Additionally, the Boltzmann equation may be solved for electrons, assuming they
only interact through elastic collisions, and that they are in equilibrium with
a small, constant electric field. This result was originally presented by
Druyvesteyn and Penning \cite{Druyvesteyn1940} and has come to be known as the
Druyvesteyn distribution. It is defined as,
\begin{equation}
  f_{\alpha} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4\Gamma(3/4)}(\kB T_\alpha)^{-3/2}
  \exp{\left[-\frac{9}{16}\left(\frac{\epsilon}{\kB T_\alpha}\right)\right]}
  \label{eq:druy}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ is the gamma function. This solution tends to suppress the
probability of higher and lower-energy electrons in favor of more intermediate
values. Figure~\ref{fig:simpledists}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/theory/figures/simpledists.eps}
  \caption{Comparison of the Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution and the
    Druyvesteyn distribution for the same average energy (illustrated by the
  dotted line).}
  \label{fig:simpledists}
\end{figure}
compares the probably distributions from equations~\ref{eq:mb} and~\ref{eq:druy}
for the same temperature $\T_\alpha$. The dotted line illustrates the average
energy for the two distributions, which is not the same as the most probably
energy.

Additional solutions of equation~\ref{eq:boltzmann} in anything but these simple
cases can be very challenging. In most situations, it is reduced to more tenable
equations by integrating over velocity-space (leaving $f$ as a function of space
and time). The first so-called moment is often called the conservation equation
or continuity equation,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cont}
  \frac{\partial n_\alpha}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (n_\alpha \vec{u_\alpha})
  = G_\alpha - L_\alpha.
\end{equation}
In this case, $\vec{v}$ has been replaced by a mean velocity $\vec{u}$, and the
collision operator has been replace by gain ($G$) and loss ($L$) terms. The gain
and loss terms are generally calculated by integrating a cross section over a
known velocity distribution.

The definition of the mean velocity, $\vec{u}$ can be obtained by multiplying
equation~\ref{eq:boltzmann} by $v$ and integrating over velocity-space, to
obtain the second moment,
\begin{equation}
  m_\alpha n_\alpha \left[ \frac{\partial \vec{u_\alpha}}{\partial t}
  + (\vec{u_\alpha} \cdot \nabla) \vec{u_\alpha}\right]
  = q_\alpha n_\alpha (\vec{E} + \vec{u_\alpha} \times \vec{B})
  - \nabla \cdot \vec{\Pi} + \vec{f}|_\mathrm{coll}.
  \label{eq:momentum}
\end{equation}
This expresses the conservation of momentum by the plasma. It provides a means
by which to solve for the mean velocity of the system, however it also
introduces two additional terms. $\vec{f}|_\mathrm{coll}$ deals with the forces
transferred to $\alpha$ via collisions. Though complex, it only depends on known
quantities. The second term, $\vec{\Pi}$, is the pressure tensor and can only be
defined by the third moment of the Boltzmann equation. In fact, each additional
moment introduces a new term requiring a higher order moment, \emph{ad
infinitum}. In most situations, this chain of equations is terminated after the
first two or three moments by the use of an additional assumption such as an
equation of state.

For our purposes, one more moment will suffice. Assuming that the pressure is
isotropic, one can multiply equation~\ref{eq:boltzmann} by $mv^2/2$, and
integrate over velocity-space. This yields the energy conservation equation,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{3}{2}p_\alpha\right) 
  + \nabla\cdot\frac{3}{2} (p_\alpha\vec{u}_\alpha)
  + p_\alpha\nabla\cdot\vec{u}_\alpha
  + \nabla\cdot\vec{q}_\alpha
  = \frac{\partial}{\partial
  t}\left(\frac{3}{2}p_\alpha\right)\bigg|_\mathrm{coll}.
  \label{eq:energy}
\end{equation}
In this case, $p$ represents the isotropic pressure, and $\vec{q}$ is the heat
flow. The first term on the \textsc{lhs} represents the total energy contained
by the species, the second term is the energy flux in and out of the volume, and
the third term accounts for changes due to compression or expansion. The
\textsc{rhs} is the collision operator which describes energy added or removed
from the system as a result of collisions.

Equations~\ref{eq:cont} and~\ref{eq:energy} are particularly important for this
study. As will be detailed in chapter~\ref{chp:modeling}, the two can be used to
create a global model of the plasma. While such a model only considers globally
averaged quantities, it can be extremely useful in characterizing the complex
evolution of multi-component plasmas.

\section{Plasma Criteria}
Though the Boltzmann equation can describe both an ionized gas and a plasma, the
two are conceptually distinct. A plasma is unique in that its dynamics are
governed by long range electromagnetic forces unlike gases in which short-range
collisions dominate. As a result, plasmas frequently feature large scale
structure and organization. Examples of these structures are ubiquitous in
astronomy where phenomena such as the aurora borealis, coronal mass ejections,
and even interstellar media all qualify as forms of plasma. How then, does one
define a plasma? There are three criteria required for an ionized gas to be
considered a plasma.

\subsection{Debye Length}
As mentioned, an ionized gas features a number of electron and ion pairs. If an
electrical perturbation is introduced into the ionized gas, the charged
particles will tend to rearrange themselves to shield it out. A plasma is an
ionized gas which is large enough for this shielding effect to occur. The
characteristic length scale for this shielding effect to take place is referred
to as the Debye length, denoted $\lambda_D$. It can be shown to be equal to
$\sqrt{\epsilon_0T_e/(en_0)}$, where $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity,
$T_e$ is the electron temperature, and $n_0$ is the plasma density. If the
characteristic length scale of the ionized gas is $L$, then $\lambda_D < L$ for
it to be considered a plasma.

\subsection{Debye Sphere}
However, the previous condition is necessary, but not sufficient for shielding
to occur. It is possible that an ionized gas may have a relatively small Debye
length, but also lack enough charged particles for shield to occur. More simply
put, it would be impossible for a single electron to shield out even the
smallest of perturbations. For that reason, the number of particles in a Debye
sphere must be greater than unity in a plasma, or {$n_0(4\pi \lambda_D^3/3) >>
1$.

\subsection{Plasma Oscillations}
Finally, a plasma may exhibit Debye shielding, but lack the long-range
interactions of a plasma. This can occur when the collision frequency with
neutral particles is too high. In this case, the behavior of the ionized gas
would be determined more by the random collisions. Therefore, the characteristic
response frequency of a plasma, commonly called the plasma frequency, must be
greater than the neutral collision frequency, or {$\omega_p > \nu$}. The plasma
frequency can be shown to be $\omega_p = \sqrt{e^2n_0/(\epsilon_0 m_e)}$.

There are many natural and man-made ionized gases which can be considered
plasmas. Figure~\ref{fig:regimes}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/theory/figures/regimes.eps}
  \caption{Illustration of the various regimes of plasma in terms of
electron temperature and density \cite{Huba2011}.}
  \label{fig:regimes}
\end{figure}
shows several categories of plasma, plotted as a function of their electron
density and temperature. As can be seen, the electron densities span seven
decades, and the densities cover in excess of 20. This broad range of conditions
presents a particularly challenging problem for both simulations and
experimental measurements.

\section{Discharge Initiation}
The Boltzmann equation is a continuous, statistical description of a plasma. By
comparison, the initial breakdown of a plasma is a highly discontinuous process
marked by its stochasticity. The initiation of a discharge is typically the
result of electron avalanches which occur randomly throughout a volume of gas.
Often, the seed electrons for a plasma are the products of ionizing cosmic rays
which generate a few electrons per cubic-centimeter. As a result, it is
necessary to consider the initiation of a discharge separately from a
pre-existing plasma.

\subsection{Townsend Mechanism}

Classically, plasmas are created by two different mechanisms, the choice of
which depends on the strength of the electric field. At lower electric fields,
the Townsend mechanism is responsible for the formation of a plasma. Consider a
two electrodes separated by a gap filled with some gas. An electron starting
near the cathode will drift toward the anode. For a large enough electric field
the electron will gain enough kinetic energy to ionize a neutral atom, producing
a second electron. The two electrons are now accelerated by the field,
instigating further ionization of the background gas. The population of
electrons quickly grows, thus the process is referred to as an electron
avalanche. Eventually, the avalanche electrons are collected at the anode.

In their wake are ions which slowly drift toward the cathode. As the ions impact
the surface of the cathode, they occasionally cause a secondary electron to be
emitted. This secondary electron initiates a new avalanche and helps to sustain
the discharge. Townsend breakdown occurs when the electron multiplication in the
avalanche compensates for the finite probability that an ion striking the
cathode releases a secondary electron. Therefore, the time required for the ions
to drift across the gap is the characteristic time it takes for a discharge to
develop via the Townsend mechanism (on the order of 1$\mu$s).

The Townsend mechanism is characterized by two parameters: $\alpha$ and
$\gamma$, the first and second Townsend coefficients. $\alpha$ is the number of
ionization events that occur per unit path-length. The value depends on the
applied electric field, and is typically expressed in terms of the reduced
electric field; the electric field divided by the neutral gas density. The
second Townsend coefficient is the probability that an ion impinging on the
cathode produces a secondary electron. The values for $\gamma$ can vary widely
and depend on the type of ion, its energy, the cathode material, contamination
of the surface, and many other factors. That said, typical values are around
0.01-0.1.

\subsection{Streamer Mechanism}

In contrast, the streamer discharge does not require secondary emission
processes. Additionally, streamer discharges can develop in time periods as
short as 1 ns, much less than the time required for Townsend breakdown. In order
to describe the streamer mechanism, again consider an electron between two
electrodes, as seen in (a) of figure~\ref{fig:streamer}.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/theory/figures/streamer.eps}
  \caption{An illustration of the development of a single streamer. (a)
    A seed electron is accelerated by the applied electric field. (b) The
    initial electron develops into an avalanche which leaves a large region
    of positive space charge, halting further advance. (c) The streamer
    propagates toward the cathode via photoionization and the anode via
    nonlocal electrons and photoionization.}
  \label{fig:streamer}
\end{figure}
The electron acquires energy from the applied electric field, and begins to
create an avalanche of electrons. The electrons in the avalanche travel with a
velocity characterized by the electron mobility, $\mu$. This term expresses the
frictional force exerted by the gas on the electrons. Like the first Townsend
coefficient, it is a function of the reduced electric field. Consequently, the
mean velocity of electrons drifting in a time-varying field $E(t)$ can be
expressed as
\begin{equation}
  u(t) = \mu(E/N_g) E(t),
\end{equation}
where $N_g$ is the neutral gas density. Given this definition of the electron
drift velocity, the total length of the avalanche may be written as
\begin{equation}
  \xi = \int_{t_0}^t u(t) dt.
  \label{eq:s_xi}
\end{equation}
Here, $t_0$ is the time at which $E(t)$ becomes high enough that the first
Townsend coefficient, $\alpha$, exceeds 0. This is considered the beginning of
the avalanche as there is no multiplication before this time.

As seen in figure~\ref{fig:streamer}, the ions generated by the ionization
events remain in place as the electron avalanche passes. This follows from the
much larger mass of the ions, and the relatively short time scale on which the
avalanche occurs. The cone-like structure of the ions results from the
collision-induced, transverse diffusion of the electrons. The free diffusion
coefficient is $D = \lambda v_mathrm{th}(E/N_g)/3$, where $\lambda$ is the mean
free path of the electrons, and $v_\mathrm{th}$ is their thermal velocity.
Following Levatter and Lin \cite{Levatter1980}, if the electrons are assumed to
diffuse equally in all directions, the electron density in the head of the
avalanche is
\begin{equation}
  n_e(r) = \frac{N_e}{\pi^{3/2}R(t)^2}\exp\left(-\frac{r^2}{R(t)^2}\right),
  \label{eq:s_density}
\end{equation}
where $r$ is the radial coordinate (relative to the center of the avalanche),
$N_e$ is the absolute electron population, $\Delta t = t - t_0$, and $R$ is the
diffusion radius. The diffusion radius can be calculated from
\begin{equation}
  R(t) = \int_{0}^{\xi} \lambda v_\mathrm{th}(\xi') d\xi',
  \label{eq:s_rad}
\end{equation}
as the thermal velocity is expected to change as more energy is deposited into
the electrons over the length of the avalanche. The dependence of $R$ on time is
implied from its dependence on $\xi$.

In a Townsend discharge, the avalanche would continue across the entire width of
the gap. On the other hand, the avalanche of a streamer grows at such a rate
that its space charge shields out the applied field. This stalls the head of the
avalanche mid-gap as seen in part (c) of figure~\ref{fig:streamer}. It is
commonly assumed that this occurs when the peak field within the head of the
avalanche becomes equal to the applied field. Again, from Levatter and Lin,
electric field can be found to equal,
\begin{eqnarray}
  E_a(r) = \frac{eN_e}{4\pi\epsilon_0R^2} F(r/R), \qquad \mathrm{where} \\
  F(r/R) = \frac{1}{R^2}\left[\mathrm{erf}(r/R)-\frac{2}{\pi^{1/2}}
           (r/R)\exp(-r^2/R^2)\right] ,
\end{eqnarray}
and $\mathrm{erf}$ is the error function. $F$ is a dimenionless function which
has a peak value of $0.428$. The number of electrons in the avalanche, is equal
to
\begin{equation}
  N_e = \int_0^\xi \alpha(\xi')d\xi'.
  \label{eq:s_pop}
\end{equation}

Here, Levatter and Lin make a number of assumptions in order to develop an
analytic and dimensionless solution for $E_{a,\mathrm{max}}(t) = E(t)$. However,
it is possible to numerically integrate equations~\ref{eq:s_xi}
and~\ref{eq:s_rad} over time until $E_{a,\mathrm{max}}$ is equal to the applied
field. This should provide a more accurate, but less general result for the
final radius and length of the avalanche. Assuming a linearly increasing
electric field, figure~\ref{fig:he_avalanche}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/theory/figures/he_avalanche.eps}
  \caption{Numerical calculations of the preionization density for homogeneous
    excitation, avalanche length, and avalanche radius in helium at a pressure
    of 1.0 Torr as a function of the slope of the electric field.}
  \label{fig:he_avalanche}
\end{figure}
shows the results of such calculations for an avalanche in 1.0 Torr of helium,
as a function of various breakdown delays. The breakdown delay is defined as the
time it takes for $\alpha > 0$. The mobilities, mean velocities, and Townsend
coefficients were interpolated from solutions of the Boltzmann equation provided
by the \smaller{BOLSIG+} code with Phelps' cross sections \cite{Phelps2002}. For
this range of breakdown delays, the avalanche was able to develop up to 6 cm in
length before it stalled. The times required for the avalanche to stall ranged
from around 13 ns for the shortest breakdown delay, and 330 ns for the longest.

Once stalled, the avalanche can no longer continue to advance toward either
electrode. At this point the avalanche can be considered a streamer as it begins
to increase its extent by several other processes. The large internal fields of
the avalanche can accelerate individual electrons and ``inject'' them in the
direction of the anode \cite{Kunhardt1980}. In addition, as the excited atoms in
the wake of the avalanche begin to radiate, they can cause photoionization
throughout the volume. Photoelectrons generated close enough to the negative
head, or positive tail of the streamer will initiate secondary avalanches which
eventually connect to the primary one. Both of these methods take place
primarily along the axis of the original avalanche, thus the streamer remains
relatively constricted in the direction transverse to the electric field.

However, these processes are not critical in the formation of a large-volume
discharge by an \acs{rpnd}. The previous description of a streamer only
considers an avalanche generated by a single electron. In reality, many can form
simultaneously assuming that there is more than one seed electron in the volume.
With sufficient pre-ionization of the volume, the strong fields of the
individual avalanches can begin to overlap. This smoothes out the field
gradients which result in constricted streamers and leads to a relatively
homogeneous breakdown.

This field overlap is roughly equivalent to a spatial overlap of the heads of
the avalanches. In this case, the condition for homogeneous breakdown is simply
$n_{e,c} > r_c^{-3}$, where $n_{e,c}$ is the preionization density, and $r_c$ is
the radius of the stalled avalanche. A plot of this condition with the breakdown
time can also be observed in figure~\ref{fig:he_avalanche}.

It is apparent that as the avalanche radius increases, the necessary
pre-ionization decreases. It is less obvious as to why the avalanche radius
decreases as the breakdown delay increases. This can be explained by the lower
slope, implied by the long breakdown delays. As the slope decreases, the
avalanche has a longer period of time to diffuse in the system, thus the
increased radius.

\section{Atomic Spectroscopy \& Notation}

Given a particular plasma, it is often desirable to measure various critical
parameters. Such measurements can be broadly split into perturbing and
non-perturbing measurements. Perturbing measurements, such as those made with
physical probes inserted into the plasma, can alter the local or even global
qualities of a plasma. In contrast, non-perturbing measurements, are passive and
do not influence the plasma in any way.

A number of non-perturbing diagnostics involve the practice of plasma
spectroscopy, or the interaction of light and plasma. Careful measurements of
the light emitted from excited atomic states can yield electron densities and
temperatures, excited state densities and temperatures, electric fields, and
magnetic fields. The topic of spectroscopy is extensive and it is neither
necessary nor desirable to cover it in full. Instead we will only consider what
is necessary to understand the emissions from a singly-excited, multi-electron
atom.

An atom is composed of a small, positively charged nucleus, orbited by
negatively charged electrons. The actual position of any single electron is
probabilistic and described by a wavefunction; solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger
equation for the atom in question. Many different wavefunctions or orbitals
exist, each described by four quantum numbers:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $n=1,2,\ldots$: the principal quantum number,
  \item $l=0,1,\ldots,n-1$: the orbital angular momentum,
  \item $m_l =-l,\ldots,l$: the magnetic quantum number, and the
  \item $s=\pm1/2$: spin quantum number.
\end{itemize}
The quantum numbers are hierarchical such that each $n$, or shell, possesses a
series of subshells, $l$, while each subshell possesses a number of individual
states, $m_l$, and each state possess one of two spins. The Pauli exclusion
principle forbids the electrons of an atom from possessing the same combination
of quantum numbers. As a result, each subsequent shell of an atom can only
contain $2(2l+1)$ electrons, after which it is considered full. The subshells
are often referred to using the nomenclature $0,1,2,3,\ldots = s,p,d,f,\ldots$.

As a result of their separation from the nucleus, the electrons in an atom have
some degree of potential energy. As the $n$ and $l$ of an electron increase, so
does its potential energy. In most cases, $m_l$ and $s$ do not affect the
potential energy of an electron. As an example, an electron in the 1s ($n=1$ and
$l=0$) subshell has the lowest possible potential energy.

Absent from external influences, the subshells are populated with electrons so
as to minimize the total potential energy of the system. This natural
arrangement is referred to as the ground state configuration. Often, but not
always, the subshells are filled sequentially and in order from lowest to
highest $l$. Provided some input energy, one or more of the electrons
surrounding the atom may transition to another orbital, increasing the potential
energy of the system. In low-temperature plasmas it usually one of the electrons
from the outermost or unfilled subshell to be excited.

In hydrogen and alkali metals, all the subshells are filled with the exception
of a lone electron in the outer (or valence) subshell. For these atoms, the
potential energy of any singly-excited configuration is uniquely determined by
this electron. As a result, the initial and final states of the atom can be
uniquely identified based on the initial and final $n$ and $l$ of the
aforementioned electron. In contrast, the potential energies of configurations
in other atoms are determined by the collective effects of all outer electrons.

This necessitates an additional means of classifying the electron configurations
in these atoms. It turns out that the states of these types of atoms can be
specified based on their total orbital angular momentum $\bm{L}=\sum \bm{l}_i$,
the total spin, $\bm{S}=\sum \bm{s}_i$, and the total angular momentum,
$\bm{J}=\bm{L}+\bm{S}$, where $i$ are all the electrons of the valence shell. In
addition, each state can be said to have either even or odd parity, defined as
$(-1)^{\sum\bm{l}_i}$, where $-1$ is odd, and $1$ is even.

Together, these values are sufficient to identify the electron configuration in
these atoms. They are often written out in a form called the term symbol which
lists the filled subshells and appends a symbol representing the outer subshell
configuration. For example, the so called triplet metastable state of helium can
be written as 1s2p$^3$P$^o_{0,1,2}$. This describes a helium atom with one
electron in the 1s subshell and a second atom in the 2p subshell. This
configuration has a total orbital angular moment of 1 (denoted by the `P'), odd
parity (denoted by the superscript `o'), a total spin of $1/2$ (the superscript
$3$ is equal to $2S+1$) and three possible values for the total angular
momentum: 0, 1, or 2 which varies depending on the spin-orbit interaction.

These excited atomic states usually have finite lifetimes as the electrons in
the excited states will often transition to lower states. This can occur
spontaneously, through the emission of a photon, or via a superelastic collision
with another particle. In the case of spontaneous transitions, only certain ones
are allowed, as defined by a set of selection rules:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\Delta S = 0$
  \item $\Delta L = \pm1$ or 0
  \item $\Delta J = \pm1$ or 0
  \item $L=0$ cannot transition to $L=0$
  \item $j=0$ cannot transition to $J=0$
\end{itemize}
These rules are determined using the electric dipole approximation. As a result,
some transitions forbidden by these rules can occur, though they occur at a much
lower rate.

Figure~\ref{fig:grotrian}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./chapters/theory/figures/grotrian.pdf}
  \caption{A partial Grotrian diagram of neutral helium \cite{Moore1968}.}
  \label{fig:grotrian}
\end{figure}
is a diagram of the energy levels in neutral helium and the allowed transitions.
In this case, the atomic states are separated into the singlet ($S=0$) and
triplet ($S = 1$) manifolds. The singlet manifold represents excited states
where the electron spins are anti-parallel, and the triplet manifold represents
excited states where the electron spins are parallel. As indicated by the first
selection rule, transitions between these two manifolds is forbidden, thus each
is something of a self-contained system.

\subsection{Spectral Lineshapes}

It is the transitions between these various excited states which concern
spectroscopy. Electrons which transition to lower energy states emit photons
which can be detected. Conversely, if an atom is exposed to a photon with an
energy matching a transition, the atom may absorb the photon. Both processes are
useful in determining the prevalence and dynamics of the excited states. This,
in turn, can be used to infer various plasma properties.

Conservation of energy requires that the energy of the absorbed or emitted
photon match the energy difference between the two states. However, the finite
lifetime of excited atomic states implies, via the time-energy formulation of
the uncertainty principle, some uncertainty in the actual energy difference
between the states. As a result, the emitted photon will possess an energy
selected from a distribution of energies.

This distribution is referred to as the spectral lineshape. The natural
lineshape of an atomic transition can be shown \cite{Siegman1986} to be a
Lorentzian of the form,
\begin{equation}
  g(\omega) = -\frac{1}{4\pi^2}\frac{A\lambda^3}{\dwa}
  \frac{1}{1 + \left[2(\omega-\omega_a)/\dwa\right]^2},
  \label{eq:lorentzian}
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the photon frequency, $A$ is the Einstein coefficient for the
transition, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the transition, $\omega_a$ is central
frequency of the transition, and $\dwa$ the full-width half maximum (\acs{fwhm})
of the transition. In the ideal case, where the atoms motionless and unaffected
by external perturbations, $\dwa = A$. This is known as the natural linewidth.

Other processes can affect the spectral lineshape. For example, inter-atomic
collisions can reduce the lifetimes of excited states. This results in
additional broadening of the line, though it retains its Loretnzian nature. As
the frequency of inter-atomic collisions increases linearly with pressure, this
phenomena is referred to as pressure broadening. It can be included in
equation~\ref{eq:lorentzian} by using $\dwa = A + BP$, where $B$ is a measured
or calculated broadening coefficient, and $P$ is the pressure.

Atomic motion can also play a role in the spectral lineshape. If an atom is
moving toward or away an observer as it emits a photon, the emitted photon will
be blue or red shifted. If this effect is averaged over the random motion of
atoms in a gas, the result is an additional broadening of the lineshape, called
Doppler broadening. Unlike pressure broadening, Doppler broadening introduces a
Gaussian component to the lineshape such that,
\begin{multline}
  g(\omega) = \sqrt{\frac{2\ln{2}}{\pi^3}}\frac{\dwa}{\dwd}
  \int_{-\infty}^\infty
  \frac{1}{[(\omega - \omega_a) - \omega']^2 + 4\dwa^2} \\
  \times \exp\left[4\ln{2}\left(\frac{\omega'}{\dwd}\right)^2\right]d\omega'.
  \label{eq:voigt}
\end{multline}
Here, $\dwd = \omega_a\sqrt{\frac{8k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{g}\ln{2}} {Mc^2}}$, is
the width of the Doppler broadening. This form of the spectral lineshape is
known as the Voigt profile, and it must be numerically integrated. In the case
that $\dwd >> \dwa$, equation~\ref{eq:voigt} can be simplified to a standard
Gaussian distribution,
\begin{equation}
  g(\omega) = \sqrt{\frac{4\log{2}}{\pi\dwd^2}}
  \exp\left[-(4\log{2})\left(\frac{\omega-\omega_a}{\dwd}\right)^2\right].

The effect of the various broadening mechanisms is most apparent in the wings of
the lineshape, far from the peak. Figure~\ref{fig:lineshapes}

illustrates the three major lineshapes with equivalent full widths. The Voigt
profile is composed of equally broad Lorentzian and Gaussian distributions. As
can be seen, the wings of the Gaussian distribution fall off very quickly. In
comparison, the Lorentzian component is observable well out to the edges of the
figure. 

The spectral lineshape can be altered by a number of other processes. Electric
fields can influence the emissions via the Stark effect, while magnetic fields
can split up degenerate states via the Zeeman effect. The fields of electrons
and nearby molecules can also alter the lineshape of a transition. While not
used in this study, such effects can be used as effective diagnostic tools for
plasmas.
