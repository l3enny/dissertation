As early as 2001, researchers have proposed the use of a novel, hybrid engine
design for use in supersonic and hypersonic flight \cite{Macheret2001}. In some
ways similar to an earlier program \cite{Gurijanov1996}, it suggested that
magnetohydrodynamic (\acs{mhd}) accelerators were an enabling technology for
hypersonic transport. Briefly, a \acs{mhd} accelerator could be used to
simultaneously produce energy and slow the inlet airflow. This would allow the
use of a conventional turbojet engine at speeds well above its normal
operational range.

However, \acs{mhd} accelerators require an ionized fluid flow. Even at the high
altitudes associated with hypersonic flight, this is not easy to achieve.
Originally, Macheret suggested the use of electron beams, carefully tuned to
coincide with the peak in the ionization cross section in air. However, the use
of electron beams in the ionization of high pressure gases is accompanied by a
large number of technical issues, similar to those of some excimer lasers.
Therefore, in 2002, Macheret et al.\ proposed the use of a \acs{rpnd} to produce
an ``electron beam'' in situ \cite{Macheret2002} akin to the beams observed in
certain \acs{fiw} studies.

The use of a \acs{rpnd} is accompanied by a reduced ionization efficiency in
comparison to an electron beam. However, it reduces the some of the
implementation challenges and Macheret argued that it offered a more efficient
and stable option than breakdown with DC electric fields. Though the densities
of \acs{fiw}s in several air-related chemistries have been measured on several
occassions \cite{Anikin1998, Aleksandrov2007, Aleksandrov2008,
Starikovskaia2006}, similar studies do not appear to exist for \acs{rpnd}s in
air. Therefore, there is a need for electron density measurements to confirm
that \acs{rpnd}s are adequate for the \acs{mhd} accelerator requirements and to
quantify their ionization efficiency.

In addition, previous studies of \acs{fiw}s in air have observed fast gas
heating of molecular systems \cite{Popov2011}. Up to 40\% of the input energy
can be converted into translational energy through dissociation of oxygen and
quenching or electronically excited nitrogen states. As the \acs{rpnd} physics
are very similar to that of the \acs{fiw}, there is the possibility that it may
also cause fast gas heating. In combustion, this can play an important role in
the chemistry, flame holding, and ignition delay. More generally, gas heating
can impact material processing and ionization efficiency. As such, it is
important to develop reliable temperature diagnostics for \acs{rpnd}s in
molecular gases.

This appendix records the development of two diagnostics for an air \acs{rpnd}
at \acs{nasa} Glenn Research Center (\acs{grc}). Measurement of the electron
density was accomplished using millimeter-wave interferometry. Plasma
interferometry measures changes in the phase and amplitude of an electromagnetic
wave which has passed through the plasma \cite{Lieberman2005}. The phase shift
is proportional to the density of electrons while the change in amplitude is
related to the electron-neutral collision frequency. As with other wave-based
techniques, the density resulting from this approach is line integrated. The
translational temperature of the system was measured via

Translational temperatures were measured by analysis of the rotational spectra
associate with the second positive system of nitrogen. Rotational spectra result
from changes in the rotational quanta of a molecule. As the energy spacing of
the rotational levels is generally quite small (often on the order of $10^{-4}$
eV), inter-molecular collisions can easily redistribute them
\cite{Herzberg1950}. Provided enough collisions, the distribution of rotational
states should reflect the distribution of translational energy for the
molecules.

\section{Experiment}

Experiments were conducted in a cylindrical vacuum chamber, reproduced in
figure~\ref{fig:nasachamber},

  \label{fig:nasachamber}
\end{figure}
with a volume of approximately 30 L. The chamber was evacuated by a Varian
TriScroll 300, scroll pump and the pressure was monitored by a capacitance
manometer. Before each experiment the chamber pressure was reduced to below 100
mTorr, after which the chamber was sealed from the pump by a bellows valve. The
chamber was then back-filled with ambient air until the pressure reached 20.0
Torr.

The discharge was sustained between two parallel cylindrical electrodes, 2.5 cm
in diameter and 0.625 cm in length. In the interferometry experiment, the
electrodes were mounted in a silicone-based dielectric epoxy, cast such that it
was flush with the faces of the electrode. Optical emission experiments
eliminated the dielectric epoxy in favor of a machinable ceramic and slightly
different geometry, seen in figure~\ref{fig:electrodes}.
\begin{figure}

    electrodes are made of copper with a ceramic sheath made of Mykroy.}
  \label{fig:electrodes}
\end{figure}


This was later replaced by a Mykroy
fitting, seen in figure~\ref{fig:electrodes}, for the optical emission
experiment. This change was made to increase the durability of the apparatus for
longer experimental operation.

The power supply was built by FID (model FPG 60-100-MC4-S5) and supplied voltage
pulses of up to 60 kV at repetition rates from 6-100 kHz with pulsewidths of 5
ns. Unless otherwise stated, all measurements were made with the power supply
operating at 20 kHz using a Wavetek FG3C as the master clock.

When the discharge was
initiated for the first time after a pump down, the chamber pressure would rise
by approximately 2 Torr after several minutes of operation. Afterward, the
pressure would continue to increase at a greatly reduced rate, on the order of
several tenths of a Torr per minute.

\section{Rotational Spectroscopy}

The approach used measured the rotational spectra of
a molecular system and used this information to infer the rotational
temperature. As a result of the close energy-spacing of the rotational levels,
this temperature is usually a good measure of the translational temperature of
the system \cite{Laux1993}. This technique is limited by the ability to detect
light from the transitions, and by the equilibration time of the translational
and rotational temperatures.

The measurement of rotational transitions is a common diagnostic for the
measurement of gas temperatures, particularly in the field of combustion.
Matching of the rotational spectra is typically accomplished with a computer
program such as Specair \cite{Laux2002} and LIFBASE \cite{Luque1999}. However, a
survey of the available programs revealed little documentation about the
calculation methods and none which provided the necessary flexibility how the
spectra were generated. This necessitated the development of a program to
automate the generation and matching of rotational spectra.
