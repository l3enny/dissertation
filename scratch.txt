How to write the lit review section:

Ways:

Historical -> Present Day
+ Provides context
+ May be considered unnecesary

Context: Writing for a more general science audience, think Gus' background.

Strictly RPND

Go with the strictly RPND approach, don't get distracted by comparing to
other types of discharges.

Apply this to lit review? Skip to post WWII?
